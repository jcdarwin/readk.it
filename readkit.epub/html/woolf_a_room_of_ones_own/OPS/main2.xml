<p>The scene, if I may ask you to follow me, was now changed. The
leaves were still falling, but in London now, not Oxbridge; and I
must ask you to imagine a room, like many thousands, with a window
looking across people's hats and vans and motor-cars to other
windows, and on the table inside the room a blank sheet of paper on
which was written in large letters WOMEN AND FICTION, but no more.
The inevitable sequel to lunching and dining at Oxbridge seemed,
unfortunately, to be a visit to the British Museum. One must strain
off what was personal and accidental in all these impressions and
so reach the pure fluid, the essential oil of truth. For that visit
to Oxbridge and the luncheon and the dinner had started a swarm of
questions. Why did men drink wine and women water? Why was one sex
so prosperous and the other so poor? What effect has poverty on
fiction? What conditions are necessary for the creation of works of
art?—a thousand questions at once suggested themselves. But one
needed answers, not questions; and an answer was only to be had by
consulting the learned and the unprejudiced, who have removed
themselves above the strife of tongue and the confusion of body and
issued the result of their reasoning and research in books which
are to be found in the British Museum. If truth is not to be found
on the shelves of the British Museum, where, I asked myself,
picking up a notebook and a pencil, is truth?</p>
<p>Thus provided, thus confident and enquiring, I set out in the
pursuit of truth. The day, though not actually wet, was dismal, and
the streets in the neighbourhood of the Museum were full of open
coal-holes, down which sacks were showering; four-wheeled cabs were
drawing up and depositing on the pavement corded boxes containing,
presumably, the entire wardrobe of some Swiss or Italian family
seeking fortune or refuge or some other desirable commodity which
is to be found in the boarding-houses of Bloomsbury in the winter.
The usual hoarse-voiced men paraded the streets with plants on
barrows. Some shouted; others sang. London was like a workshop.
London was like a machine. We were all being shot backwards and
forwards on this plain foundation to make some pattern. The British
Museum was another department of the factory. The swing-doors swung
open; and there one stood under the vast dome, as if one were a
thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly encircled
by a band of famous names. One went to the counter; one took a slip
of paper; one opened a volume of the catalogue, and the five dots
here indicate five separate minutes of stupefaction, wonder and
bewilderment. Have you any notion of how many books are written
about women in the course of one year? Have you any notion how many
are written by men? Are you aware that you are, perhaps, the most
discussed animal in the universe? Here had I come with a notebook
and a pencil proposing to spend a morning reading, supposing that
at the end of the morning I should have transferred the truth to my
notebook. But I should need to be a herd of elephants, I thought,
and a wilderness of spiders, desperately referring to the animals
that are reputed longest lived and most multitudinously eyed, to
cope with all this. I should need claws of steel and beak of brass
even to penetrate the husk. How shall I ever find the grains of
truth embedded in all this mass of paper? I asked myself, and in
despair began running my eye up and down the long list of titles.
Even the names of the books gave me food for thought. Sex and its
nature might well attract doctors and biologists; but what was
surprising and difficult of explanation was the fact that
sex—woman, that is to say—also attracts agreeable essayists,
light-fingered novelists, young men who have taken the M.A. degree;
men who have taken no degree; men who have no apparent
qualification save that they are not women. Some of these books
were, on the face of it, frivolous and facetious; but many, on the
other hand, were serious and prophetic, moral and hortatory. Merely
to read the titles suggested innumerable schoolmasters, innumerable
clergymen mounting their platforms and pulpits and holding forth
with loquacity which far exceeded the hour usually alloted to such
discourse on this one subject. It was a most strange phenomenon;
and apparently—here I consulted the letter M—one confined to the
male sex. Women do not write books about men—a fact that I could
not help welcoming with relief, for if I had first to read all that
men have written about women, then all that women have written
about men, the aloe that flowers once in a hundred years would
flower twice before I could set pen to paper. So, making a
perfectly arbitrary choice of a dozen volumes or so, I sent my
slips of paper to lie in the wire tray, and waited in my stall,
among the other seekers for the essential oil of truth.</p>
<p>What could be the reason, then, of this curious disparity, I
wondered, drawing cart-wheels on the slips of paper provided by the
British taxpayer for other purposes. Why are women, judging from
this catalogue, so much more interesting to men than men are to
women? A very curious fact it seemed, and my mind wandered to
picture the lives of men who spend their time in writing books
about women; whether they were old or young, married or unmarried,
red-nosed or hump-backed—anyhow, it was flattering, vaguely, to
feel oneself the object of such attention provided that it was not
entirely bestowed by the crippled and the infirm—so I pondered
until all such frivolous thoughts were ended by an avalanche of
books sliding down on to the desk in front of me. Now the trouble
began. The student who has been trained in research at Oxbridge has
no doubt some method of shepherding his question past all
distractions till it runs into his answer as a sheep runs into its
pen. The student by my side, for instance, who was copying
assiduously from a scientific manual, was, I felt sure, extracting
pure nuggets of the essential ore every ten minutes or so. His
little grunts of satisfaction indicated so much. But if,
unfortunately, one has had no training in a university, the
question far from being shepherded to its pen flies like a
frightened flock hither and thither, helter-skelter, pursued by a
whole pack of hounds. Professors, schoolmasters, sociologists,
clergymen, novelists, essayists, journalists, men who had no
qualification save that they were not women, chased my simple and
single question—Why are some women poor?—until it became fifty
questions; until the fifty questions leapt frantically into
midstream and were carried away. Every page in my notebook was
scribbled over with notes. To show the state of mind I was in, I
will read you a few of them, explaining that the page was headed
quite simply, WOMEN AND POVERTY, in block letters; but what
followed was something like this:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Here I drew breath and added, indeed, in the margin, Why does
Samuel Butler say, 'Wise men never say what they think of women'?
Wise men never say anything else apparently. But, I continued,
leaning back in my chair and looking at the vast dome in which I
was a single but by now somewhat harassed thought, what is so
unfortunate is that wise men never think the same thing about
women. Here is Pope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most women have no character at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is La Bruyère:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Les femmes sont extrêmes, elles sont meilleures ou pires que les
hommes——</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a direct contradiction by keen observers who were contemporary.
Are they capable of education or incapable? Napoleon thought them
incapable. Dr Johnson thought the opposite<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_2" id="footnote_2_call">[2]</a>. Have they
souls or have they not souls? Some savages say they have none.
Others, on the contrary, maintain that women are half divine and
worship them on that account<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_3" id="footnote_3_call">[3]</a>. Some sages
hold that they are shallower in the brain; others that they are
deeper in the consciousness. Goethe honoured them; Mussolini
despises them. Wherever one looked men thought about women and
thought differently. It was impossible to make head or tail of it
all, I decided, glancing with envy at the reader next door who was
making the neatest abstracts, headed often with an A or a B or a C,
while my own notebook rioted with the wildest scribble of
contradictory jottings. It was distressing, it was bewildering, it
was humiliating. Truth had run through my fingers. Every drop had
escaped.</p>
<p>I could not possibly go home, I reflected, and add as a serious
contribution to the study of women and fiction that women have less
hair on their bodies than men, or that the age of puberty among the
South Sea Islanders is nine—or is it ninety?—even the handwriting
had become in its distraction indecipherable. It was disgraceful to
have nothing more weighty or respectable to show after a whole
morning's work. And if I could not grasp the truth about W. (as for
brevity's sake I had come to call her) in the past, why bother
about W. in the future? It seemed pure waste of time to consult all
those gentlemen who specialize in woman and her effect on whatever
it may be—politics, children, wages, morality—numerous and learned
as they are. One might as well leave their books unopened.</p>
<p>But while I pondered I had unconsciously, in my listlessness, in
my desperation, been drawing a picture where I should, like my
neighbour, have been writing a conclusion. I had been drawing a
face, a figure. It was the face and the figure of Professor von X
engaged in writing his monumental work entitled THE MENTAL, MORAL,
AND PHYSICAL INFERIORITY OF THE FEMALE SEX. He was not in my
picture a man attractive to women. He was heavily built; he had a
great jowl; to balance that he had very small eyes; he was very red
in the face. His expression suggested that he was labouring under
some emotion that made him jab his pen on the paper as if he were
killing some noxious insect as he wrote, but even when he had
killed it that did not satisfy him; he must go on killing it; and
even so, some cause for anger and irritation remained. Could it be
his wife, I asked, looking at my picture? Was she in love with a
cavalry officer? Was the cavalry officer slim and elegant and
dressed in astrakhan? Had he been laughed at, to adopt the Freudian
theory, in his cradle by a pretty girl? For even in his cradle the
professor, I thought, could not have been an attractive child.
Whatever the reason, the professor was made to look very angry and
very ugly in my sketch, as he wrote his great book upon the mental,
moral and physical inferiority of women. Drawing pictures was an
idle way of finishing an unprofitable morning's work. Yet it is in
our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes
comes to the top. A very elementary exercise in psychology, not to
be dignified by the name of psychoanalysis, showed me, on looking
at my notebook, that the sketch of the angry professor had been
made in anger. Anger had snatched my pencil while I dreamt. But
what was anger doing there? Interest, confusion, amusement,
boredom—all these emotions I could trace and name as they succeeded
each other throughout the morning. Had anger, the black snake, been
lurking among them? Yes, said the sketch, anger had. It referred me
unmistakably to the one book, to the one phrase, which had roused
the demon; it was the professor's statement about the mental, moral
and physical inferiority of women. My heart had leapt. My cheeks
had burnt. I had flushed with anger. There was nothing specially
remarkable, however foolish, in that. One does not like to be told
that one is naturally the inferior of a little man—I looked at the
student next me—who breathes hard, wears a ready-made tie, and has
not shaved this fortnight. One has certain foolish vanities. It is
only human nature, I reflected, and began drawing cartwheels and
circles over the angry professor's face till he looked like a
burning bush or a flaming comet—anyhow, an apparition without human
semblance or significance. The professor was nothing now but a
faggot burning on the top of Hampstead Heath. Soon my own anger was
explained and done with; but curiosity remained. How explain the
anger of the professors? Why were they angry? For when it came to
analysing the impression left by these books there was always an
element of heat. This heat took many forms; it showed itself in
satire, in sentiment, in curiosity, in reprobation. But there was
another element which was often present and could not immediately
be identified. Anger, I called it. But it was anger that had gone
underground and mixed itself with all kinds of other emotions. To
judge from its odd effects, it was anger disguised and complex, not
anger simple and open.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, all these books, I thought, surveying the
pile on the desk, are worthless for my purposes. They were
worthless scientifically, that is to say, though humanly they were
full of instruction, interest, boredom, and very queer facts about
the habits of the Fiji Islanders. They had been written in the red
light of emotion and not in the white light of truth. Therefore
they must be returned to the central desk and restored each to his
own cell in the enormous honeycomb. All that I had retrieved from
that morning's work had been the one fact of anger. The
professors—I lumped them together thus—were angry. But why, I asked
myself, having returned the books, why, I repeated, standing under
the colonnade among the pigeons and the prehistoric canoes, why are
they angry? And, asking myself this question, I strolled off to
find a place for luncheon. What is the real nature of what I call
for the moment their anger? I asked. Here was a puzzle that would
last all the time that it takes to be served with food in a small
restaurant somewhere near the British Museum. Some previous luncher
had left the lunch edition of the evening paper on a chair, and,
waiting to be served, I began idly reading the headlines. A ribbon
of very large letters ran across the page. Somebody had made a big
score in South Africa. Lesser ribbons announced that Sir Austen
Chamberlain was at Geneva. A meat axe with human hair on it had
been found in a cellar. Mr justice —— commented in the Divorce
Courts upon the Shamelessness of Women. Sprinkled about the paper
were other pieces of news. A film actress had been lowered from a
peak in California and hung suspended in mid-air. The weather was
going to be foggy. The most transient visitor to this planet, I
thought, who picked up this paper could not fail to be aware, even
from this scattered testimony, that England is under the rule of a
patriarchy. Nobody in their senses could fail to detect the
dominance of the professor. His was the power and the money and the
influence. He was the proprietor of the paper and its editor and
sub-editor. He was the Foreign Secretary and the judge. He was the
cricketer; he owned the racehorses and the yachts. He was the
director of the company that pays two hundred per cent to its
shareholders. He left millions to charities and colleges that were
ruled by himself. He suspended the film actress in mid-air. He will
decide if the hair on the meat axe is human; he it is who will
acquit or convict the murderer, and hang him, or let him go free.
With the exception of the fog he seemed to control everything. Yet
he was angry. I knew that he was angry by this token. When I read
what he wrote about women—I thought, not of what he was saying, but
of himself. When an arguer argues dispassionately he thinks only of
the argument; and the reader cannot help thinking of the argument
too. If he had written dispassionately about women, had used
indisputable proofs to establish his argument and had shown no
trace of wishing that the result should be one thing rather than
another, one would not have been angry either. One would have
accepted the fact, as one accepts the fact that a pea is green or a
canary yellow. So be it, I should have said. But I had been angry
because he was angry. Yet it seemed absurd, I thought, turning over
the evening paper, that a man with all this power should be angry.
Or is anger, I wondered, somehow, the familiar, the attendant
sprite on power? Rich people, for example, are often angry because
they suspect that the poor want to seize their wealth. The
professors, or patriarchs, as it might be more accurate to call
them, might be angry for that reason partly, but partly for one
that lies a little less obviously on the surface. Possibly they
were not 'angry' at all; often, indeed, they were admiring,
devoted, exemplary in the relations of private life. Possibly when
the professor insisted a little too emphatically upon the
inferiority of women, he was concerned not with their inferiority,
but with his own superiority. That was what he was protecting
rather hot-headedly and with too much emphasis, because it was a
jewel to him of the rarest price. Life for both sexes—and I looked
at them, shouldering their way along the pavement—is arduous,
difficult, a perpetual struggle. It calls for gigantic courage and
strength. More than anything, perhaps, creatures of illusion as we
are, it calls for confidence in oneself. Without self-confidence we
are as babes in the cradle. And how can we generate this
imponderable quality, which is yet so invaluable, most quickly? By
thinking that other people are inferior to one self. By feeling
that one has some innate superiority—it may be wealth, or rank, a
straight nose, or the portrait of a grandfather by Romney—for there
is no end to the pathetic devices of the human imagination—over
other people. Hence the enormous importance to a patriarch who has
to conquer, who has to rule, of feeling that great numbers of
people, half the human race indeed, are by nature inferior to
himself. It must indeed be one of the chief sources of his power.
But let me turn the light of this observation on to real life, I
thought. Does it help to explain some of those psychological
puzzles that one notes in the margin of daily life? Does it explain
my astonishment of the other day when Z, most humane, most modest
of men, taking up some book by Rebecca West and reading a passage
in it, exclaimed, 'The arrant feminist! She says that men are
snobs!' The exclamation, to me so surprising—for why was Miss West
an arrant feminist for making a possibly true if uncomplimentary
statement about the other sex?—was not merely the cry of wounded
vanity; it was a protest against some infringement of his power to
believe in himself. Women have served all these centuries as
looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of
reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size. Without
that power probably the earth would still be swamp and jungle. The
glories of all our wars would he unknown. We should still be
scratching the outlines of deer on the remains of mutton bones and
bartering flints for sheep skins or whatever simple ornament took
our unsophisticated taste. Supermen and Fingers of Destiny would
never have existed. The Czar and the Kaiser would never have worn
crowns or lost them. Whatever may be their use in civilized
societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action.
That is why Napoleon and Mussolini both insist so emphatically upon
the inferiority of women, for if they were not inferior, they would
cease to enlarge. That serves to explain in part the necessity that
women so often are to men. And it serves to explain how restless
they are under her criticism; how impossible it is for her to say
to them this book is bad, this picture is feeble, or whatever it
may be, without giving far more pain and rousing far more anger
than a man would do who gave the same criticism. For if she begins
to tell the truth, the figure in the looking-glass shrinks; his
fitness for life is diminished. How is he to go on giving
judgement, civilizing natives, making laws, writing books, dressing
up and speechifying at banquets, unless he can see himself at
breakfast and at dinner at least twice the size he really is? So I
reflected, crumbling my bread and stirring my coffee and now and
again looking at the people in the street. The looking-glass vision
is of supreme importance because it charges the vitality; it
stimulates the nervous system. Take it away and man may die, like
the drug fiend deprived of his cocaine. Under the spell of that
illusion, I thought, looking out of the window, half the people on
the pavement are striding to work. They put on their hats and coats
in the morning under its agreeable rays. They start the day
confident, braced, believing themselves desired at Miss Smith's tea
party; they say to themselves as they go into the room, I am the
superior of half the people here, and it is thus that they speak
with that self-confidence, that self-assurance, which have had such
profound consequences in public life and lead to such curious notes
in the margin of the private mind.</p>
<p>But these contributions to the dangerous and fascinating subject
of the psychology of the other sex—it is one, I hope, that you will
investigate when you have five hundred a year of your own—were
interrupted by the necessity of paying the bill. It came to five
shillings and ninepence. I gave the waiter a ten-shilling note and
he went to bring me change. There was another ten-shilling note in
my purse; I noticed it, because it is a fact that still takes my
breath away the power of my purse to breed ten-shilling notes
automatically. I open it and there they are. Society gives me
chicken and coffee, bed and lodging, in return for a certain number
of pieces of paper which were left me by an aunt, for no other
reason than that I share her name.</p>
<p>My aunt, Mary Beton, I must tell you, died by a fall from her
horse when she was riding out to take the air in Bombay. The news
of my legacy reached me one night about the same time that the act
was passed that gave votes to women. A solicitor's letter fell into
the post-box and when I opened it I found that she had left me five
hundred pounds a year for ever. Of the two—the vote and the
money—the money, I own, seemed infinitely the more important.
Before that I had made my living by cadging odd jobs from
newspapers, by reporting a donkey show here or a wedding there; I
had earned a few pounds by addressing envelopes, reading to old
ladies, making artificial flowers, teaching the alphabet to small
children in a kindergarten. Such were the chief occupations that
were open to women before 1918. I need not, I am afraid, describe
in any detail the hardness of the work, for you know perhaps women
who have done it; nor the difficulty of living on the money when it
was earned, for you may have tried. But what still remains with me
as a worse infliction than either was the poison of fear and
bitterness which those days bred in me. To begin with, always to be
doing work that one did not wish to do, and to do it like a slave,
flattering and fawning, not always necessarily perhaps, but it
seemed necessary and the stakes were too great to run risks; and
then the thought of that one gift which it was death to hide—a
small one but dear to the possessor—perishing and with it my self,
my soul,—all this became like a rust eating away the bloom of the
spring, destroying the tree at its heart. However, as I say, my
aunt died; and whenever I change a ten-shilling note a little of
that rust and corrosion is rubbed off, fear and bitterness go.
Indeed, I thought, slipping the silver into my purse, it is
remarkable, remembering the bitterness of those days, what a change
of temper a fixed income will bring about. No force in the world
can take from me my five hundred pounds. Food, house and clothing
are mine forever. Therefore not merely do effort and labour cease,
but also hatred and bitterness. I need not hate any man; he cannot
hurt me. I need not flatter any man; he has nothing to give me. So
imperceptibly I found myself adopting a new attitude towards the
other half of the human race. It was absurd to blame any class or
any sex, as a whole. Great bodies of people are never responsible
for what they do. They are driven by instincts which are not within
their control. They too, the patriarchs, the professors, had
endless difficulties, terrible drawbacks to contend with. Their
education had been in some ways as faulty as my own. It had bred in
them defects as great. True, they had money and power, but only at
the cost of harbouring in their breasts an eagle, a vulture,
forever tearing the liver out and plucking at the lungs—the
instinct for possession, the rage for acquisition which drives them
to desire other people's fields and goods perpetually; to make
frontiers and flags; battleships and poison gas; to offer up their
own lives and their children's lives. Walk through the Admiralty
Arch (I had reached that monument), or any other avenue given up to
trophies and cannon, and reflect upon the kind of glory celebrated
there. Or watch in the spring sunshine the stockbroker and the
great barrister going indoors to make money and more money and more
money when it is a fact that five hundred pounds a year will keep
one alive in the sunshine. These are unpleasant instincts to
harbour, I reflected. They are bred of the conditions of life; of
the lack of civilization, I thought, looking at the statue of the
Duke of Cambridge, and in particular at the feathers in his cocked
hat, with a fixity that they have scarcely ever received before.
And, as I realized these drawbacks, by degrees fear and bitterness
modified themselves into pity and toleration; and then in a year or
two, pity and toleration went, and the greatest release of all
came, which is freedom to think of things in themselves. That
building, for example, do I like it or not? Is that picture
beautiful or not? Is that in my opinion a good book or a bad?
Indeed my aunt's legacy unveiled the sky to me, and substituted for
the large and imposing figure of a gentleman, which Milton
recommended for my perpetual adoration, a view of the open sky.</p>
<p>So thinking, so speculating I found my way back to my house by
the river. Lamps were being lit and an indescribable change had
come over London since the morning hour. It was as if the great
machine after labouring all day had made with our help a few yards
of something very exciting and beautiful—a fiery fabric flashing
with red eyes, a tawny monster roaring with hot breath. Even the
wind seemed flung like a flag as it lashed the houses and rattled
the hoardings.</p>
<p>In my little street, however, domesticity prevailed. The house
painter was descending his ladder; the nursemaid was wheeling the
perambulator carefully in and out back to nursery tea; the
coal-heaver was folding his empty sacks on top of each other; the
woman who keeps the green grocer's shop was adding up the day's
takings with her hands in red mittens. But so engrossed was I with
the problem you have laid upon my shoulders that I could not see
even these usual sights without referring them to one centre. I
thought how much harder it is now than it must have been even a
century ago to say which of these em ployments is the higher, the
more necessary. Is it better to be a coal-heaver or a nursemaid; is
the charwoman who has brought up eight children of less value to
the world than, the barrister who has made a hundred thousand
pounds? it is useless to ask such questions; for nobody can answer
them. Not only do the comparative values of charwomen and lawyers
rise and fall from decade to decade, but we have no rods with which
to measure them even as they are at the moment. I had been foolish
to ask my professor to furnish me with 'indisputable proofs' of
this or that in his argument about women. Even if one could state
the value of any one gift at the moment, those values will change;
in a century's time very possibly they will have changed
completely. Moreover, in a hundred years, I thought, reaching my
own doorstep, women will have ceased to be the protected sex.
Logically they will take part in all the activities and exertions
that were once denied them. The nursemaid will heave coal. The
shopwoman will drive an engine. All assumptions founded on the
facts observed when women were the protected sex will have
disappeared—as, for example (here a squad of soldiers marched down
the street), that women and clergymen and gardeners live longer
than other people. Remove that protection, expose them to the same
exertions and activities, make them soldiers and sailors and
engine-drivers and dock labourers, and will not women die off so
much younger, so much quicker, than men that one will say, 'I saw a
woman to-day', as one used to say, 'I saw an aeroplane'. Anything
may happen when womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation,
I thought, opening the door. But what bearing has all this upon the
subject of my paper, Women and Fiction? I asked, going indoors.</p>
