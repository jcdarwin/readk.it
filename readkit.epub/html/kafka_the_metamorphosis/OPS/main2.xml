<div class="text">
<p>Gregor's serious wound, from which he suffered for over a
month—since no one ventured to remove the apple, it remained in his
flesh as a visible reminder—seemed by itself to have reminded the
father that, in spite of his present unhappy and hateful
appearance, Gregor was a member of the family, something one should
not treat as an enemy, and that it was, on the contrary, a
requirement of family duty to suppress one's aversion and to
endure—nothing else, just endure. And if through his wound Gregor
had now apparently lost for good his ability to move and for the
time being needed many, many minutes to crawl across his room, like
an aged invalid—so far as creeping up high was concerned, that was
unimaginable—nevertheless for this worsening of his condition, in
his opinion, he did get completely satisfactory compensation,
because every day towards evening the door to the living room,
which he was in the habit of keeping a sharp eye on even one or two
hours beforehand, was opened, so that he, lying down in the
darkness of his room, invisible from the living room, could see the
entire family at the illuminated table and listen to their
conversation, to a certain extent with their common permission, a
situation quite different from what had happened before.</p>
<p>Of course, it was no longer the animated social interaction of
former times, which Gregor in small hotel rooms had always thought
about with a certain longing, when, tired out, he had had to throw
himself into the damp bedclothes. For the most part what went on
now was very quiet. After the evening meal, the father fell asleep
quickly in his arm chair. The mother and sister talked guardedly to
each other in the stillness. Bent far over, the mother sewed fine
undergarments for a fashion shop. The sister, who had taken on a
job as a salesgirl, in the evening studied stenography and French,
so as perhaps later to obtain a better position. Sometimes the
father woke up and, as if he was quite ignorant that he had been
asleep, said to the mother "How long you have been sewing today?"
and went right back to sleep, while the mother and the sister
smiled tiredly to each other.</p>
<p>With a sort of stubbornness the father refused to take off his
servant's uniform even at home, and while his sleeping gown hung
unused on the coat hook, the father dozed completely dressed in his
place, as if he was always ready for his responsibility and even
here was waiting for the voice of his superior. As a result, in
spite of all the care of the mother and sister, his uniform, which
even at the start was not new, grew dirty, and Gregor looked, often
for the entire evening, at this clothing, with stains all over it
and with its gold buttons always polished, in which the old man,
although very uncomfortable, slept peacefully nonetheless.</p>
<p>As soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried gently
encouraging the father to wake up and then persuading him to go to
bed, on the ground that he couldn't get a proper sleep here and
that the father, who had to report for service at six o'clock,
really needed a good sleep. But in his stubbornness, which had
gripped him since he had become a servant, he insisted always on
staying even longer by the table, although he regularly fell asleep
and then could only be prevailed upon with the greatest difficulty
to trade his chair for the bed. No matter how much the mother and
sister might at that point work on him with small admonitions, for
a quarter of an hour he would remain shaking his head slowly, his
eyes closed, without standing up. The mother would pull him by the
sleeve and speak flattering words into his ear; the sister would
leave her work to help her mother, but that would not have the
desired effect on the father. He would settle himself even more
deeply in his arm chair. Only when the two women grabbed him under
the armpits would he throw his eyes open, look back and forth at
the mother and sister, and habitually say "This is a life. This is
the peace and quiet of my old age." And propped up by both women,
he would heave himself up elaborately, as if for him it was the
greatest trouble, allow himself to be led to the door by the women,
wave them away there, and proceed on his own from there, while the
mother quickly threw down her sewing implements and the sister her
pen in order to run after the father and help him some more.</p>
<p>In this overworked and exhausted family who had time to worry
any longer about Gregor more than was absolutely necessary? The
household was constantly getting smaller. The servant girl was now
let go. A huge bony cleaning woman with white hair flying all over
her head came in the morning and evening to do the heaviest work.
The mother took care of everything else in addition to her
considerable sewing work. It even happened that various pieces of
family jewellery, which previously the mother and sister had been
overjoyed to wear on social and festive occasions, were sold, as
Gregor found out in the evening from the general discussion of the
prices they had fetched. But the greatest complaint was always that
they could not leave this apartment, which was too big for their
present means, since it was impossible to imagine how Gregor might
be moved. But Gregor fully recognized that it was not just
consideration for him which was preventing a move, for he could
have been transported easily in a suitable box with a few air
holes. The main thing holding the family back from a change in
living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the
idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in
their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.</p>
<p>What the world demands of poor people they now carried out to an
extreme degree. The father brought breakfast to the petty officials
at the bank, the mother sacrificed herself for the undergarments of
strangers, the sister behind her desk was at the beck and call of
customers, but the family's energies did not extend any further.
And the wound in his back began to pain Gregor all over again, when
now mother and sister, after they had escorted the father to bed,
came back, let their work lie, moved close together, and sat cheek
to cheek and when his mother would now say, pointing to Gregor's
room, "Close the door, Grete," and when Gregor was again in the
darkness, while close by the women mingled their tears or, quite
dry eyed, stared at the table.</p>
<p>Gregor spent his nights and days with hardly any sleep.
Sometimes he thought that the next time the door opened he would
take over the family arrangements just as he had earlier. In his
imagination appeared again, after a long time, his employer and
supervisor and the apprentices, the excessively spineless
custodian, two or three friends from other businesses, a
chambermaid from a hotel in the provinces, a loving fleeting
memory, a female cashier from a hat shop, whom he had seriously but
too slowly courted—they all appeared mixed in with strangers or
people he had already forgotten, but instead of helping him and his
family, they were all unapproachable, and he was happy to see them
disappear.</p>
<p>But then he was in no mood to worry about his family. He was
filled with sheer anger over the wretched care he was getting, even
though he couldn't imagine anything which he might have an appetite
for. Still, he made plans about how he could take from the larder
what he at all account deserved, even if he wasn't hungry. Without
thinking any more about how they might be able to give Gregor
special pleasure, the sister now kicked some food or other very
quickly into his room in the morning and at noon, before she ran
off to her shop, and in the evening, quite indifferent to whether
the food had perhaps only been tasted or, what happened most
frequently, remained entirely undisturbed, she whisked it out with
one sweep of her broom. The task of cleaning his room, which she
now always carried out in the evening, could not be done any more
quickly. Streaks of dirt ran along the walls; here and there lay
tangles of dust and garbage. At first, when his sister arrived,
Gregor positioned himself in a particularly filthy corner in order
with this posture to make something of a protest. But he could have
well stayed there for weeks without his sister's changing her ways.
In fact, she perceived the dirt as much as he did, but she had
decided just to let it stay.</p>
<p>In this business, with a touchiness which was quite new to her
and which had generally taken over the entire family, she kept
watch to see that the cleaning of Gregor's room remained reserved
for her. Once his mother had undertaken a major cleaning of
Gregor's room, which she had only completed successfully after
using a few buckets of water. But the extensive dampness made
Gregor sick and he lay supine, embittered and immobile on the
couch. However, the mother's punishment was not delayed for long.
For in the evening the sister had hardly observed the change in
Gregor's room before she ran into the living room mightily offended
and, in spite of her mother's hand lifted high in entreaty, broke
out in a fit of crying. Her parents—the father had, of course,
woken up with a start in his arm chair—at first looked at her
astonished and helpless, until they started to get agitated.
Turning to his right, the father heaped reproaches on the mother
that she was not to take over the cleaning of Gregor's room from
the sister and, turning to his left, he shouted at the sister that
she would no longer be allowed to clean Gregor's room ever again,
while the mother tried to pull the father, beside himself in his
excitement, into the bed room. The sister, shaken by her crying
fit, pounded on the table with her tiny fists, and Gregor hissed at
all this, angry that no one thought about shutting the door and
sparing him the sight of this commotion.</p>
<p>But even when the sister, exhausted from her daily work, had
grown tired of caring for Gregor as she had before, even then the
mother did not have to come at all on her behalf. And Gregor did
not have to be neglected. For now the cleaning woman was there.
This old widow, who in her long life must have managed to survive
the worst with the help of her bony frame, had no real horror of
Gregor. Without being in the least curious, she had once by chance
opened Gregor's door. At the sight of Gregor, who, totally
surprised, began to scamper here and there, although no one was
chasing him, she remained standing with her hands folded across her
stomach staring at him. Since then she did not fail to open the
door furtively a little every morning and evening to look in on
Gregor. At first, she also called him to her with words which she
presumably thought were friendly, like "Come here for a bit, old
dung beetle!" or "Hey, look at the old dung beetle!" Addressed in
such a manner, Gregor answered nothing, but remained motionless in
his place, as if the door had not been opened at all. If only,
instead of allowing this cleaning woman to disturb him uselessly
whenever she felt like it, they had given her orders to clean up
his room every day! One day in the early morning—a hard downpour,
perhaps already a sign of the coming spring, struck the window
panes—when the cleaning woman started up once again with her usual
conversation, Gregor was so bitter that he turned towards her, as
if for an attack, although slowly and weakly. But instead of being
afraid of him, the cleaning woman merely lifted up a chair standing
close by the door and, as she stood there with her mouth wide open,
her intention was clear: she would close her mouth only when the
chair in her hand had been thrown down on Gregor's back. "This goes
no further, all right?" she asked, as Gregor turned himself around
again, and she placed the chair calmly back in the corner.</p>
<p>Gregor ate hardly anything any more. Only when he chanced to
move past the food which had been prepared did he, as a game, take
a bit into his mouth, hold it there for hours, and generally spit
it out again. At first he thought it might be his sadness over the
condition of his room which kept him from eating, but he very soon
became reconciled to the alterations in his room. People had grown
accustomed to put into storage in his room things which they
couldn't put anywhere else, and at this point there were many such
things, now that they had rented one room of the apartment to three
lodgers. These solemn gentlemen—all three had full beards, as
Gregor once found out through a crack in the door—were meticulously
intent on tidiness, not only in their own room but, since they had
now rented a room here, in the entire household, and particularly
in the kitchen. They simply did not tolerate any useless or shoddy
stuff. Moreover, for the most part they had brought with them their
own pieces of furniture. Thus, many items had become superfluous,
and these were not really things one could sell or things people
wanted to throw out. All these items ended up in Gregor's room,
even the box of ashes and the garbage pail from the kitchen. The
cleaning woman, always in a hurry, simply flung anything that was
momentarily useless into Gregor's room. Fortunately Gregor
generally saw only the relevant object and the hand which held it.
The cleaning woman perhaps was intending, when time and opportunity
allowed, to take the stuff out again or to throw everything out all
at once, but in fact the things remained lying there, wherever they
had ended up at the first throw, unless Gregor squirmed his way
through the accumulation of junk and moved it. At first he was
forced to do this because otherwise there was no room for him to
creep around, but later he did it with a growing pleasure, although
after such movements, tired to death and feeling wretched, he
didn't budge for hours.</p>
<p>Because the lodgers sometimes also took their evening meal at
home in the common living room, the door to the living room stayed
shut on many evenings. But Gregor had no trouble at all going
without the open door. Already on many evenings when it was open he
had not availed himself of it, but, without the family noticing,
was stretched out in the darkest corner of his room. However, once
the cleaning woman had left the door to the living room slightly
ajar, and it remained open even when the lodgers came in in the
evening and the lights were put on. They sat down at the head of
the table, where in earlier days the mother, the father, and Gregor
had eaten, unfolded their serviettes, and picked up their knives
and forks. The mother immediately appeared in the door with a dish
of meat and right behind her the sister with a dish piled high with
potatoes. The food gave off a lot of steam. The gentlemen lodgers
bent over the plate set before them, as if they wanted to check it
before eating, and in fact the one who sat in the middle—for the
other two he seemed to serve as the authority—cut off a piece of
meat still on the plate obviously to establish whether it was
sufficiently tender and whether or not something should be shipped
back to the kitchen. He was satisfied, and mother and sister, who
had looked on in suspense, began to breathe easily and to
smile.</p>
<p>The family itself ate in the kitchen. In spite of that, before
the father went into the kitchen, he came into the room and with a
single bow, cap in hand, made a tour of the table. The lodgers rose
up collectively and murmured something in their beards. Then, when
they were alone, they ate almost in complete silence. It seemed odd
to Gregor that, out of all the many different sorts of sounds of
eating, what was always audible was their chewing teeth, as if by
that Gregor should be shown that people needed their teeth to eat
and that nothing could be done even with the most handsome
toothless jawbone. "I really do have an appetite," Gregor said to
himself sorrowfully, "but not for these things. How these lodgers
stuff themselves, and I am dying."</p>
<p>On this very evening the violin sounded from the kitchen. Gregor
didn't remember hearing it all through this period. The lodgers had
already ended their night meal, the middle one had pulled out a
newspaper and had given each of the other two a page, and they were
now leaning back, reading and smoking. When the violin started
playing, they became attentive, got up, and went on tiptoe to the
hall door, at which they remained standing pressed up against one
another. They must have been audible from the kitchen, because the
father called out "Perhaps the gentlemen don't like the playing? It
can be stopped at once." "On the contrary," stated the lodger in
the middle, "might the young woman not come into us and play in the
room here, where it is really much more comfortable and cheerful?"
"Oh, thank you," cried out the father, as if he were the one
playing the violin. The men stepped back into the room and waited.
Soon the father came with the music stand, the mother with the
sheet music, and the sister with the violin. The sister calmly
prepared everything for the recital. The parents, who had never
previously rented a room and therefore exaggerated their politeness
to the lodgers, dared not sit on their own chairs. The father
leaned against the door, his right hand stuck between two buttons
of his buttoned-up uniform. The mother, however, accepted a chair
offered by one lodger. Since she left the chair sit where the
gentleman had chanced to put it, she sat to one side in a
corner.</p>
<p>The sister began to play. The father and mother, one on each
side, followed attentively the movements of her hands. Attracted by
the playing, Gregor had ventured to advance a little further
forward and his head was already in the living room. He scarcely
wondered about the fact that recently he had had so little
consideration for the others. Earlier this consideration had been
something he was proud of. And for that very reason he would have
had at this moment more reason to hide away, because as a result of
the dust which lay all over his room and flew around with the
slightest movement, he was totally covered in dirt. On his back and
his sides he carted around with him dust, threads, hair, and
remnants of food. His indifference to everything was much too great
for him to lie on his back and scour himself on the carpet, as he
often had done earlier during the day. In spite of his condition he
had no timidity about inching forward a bit on the spotless floor
of the living room.</p>
<p>In any case, no one paid him any attention. The family was all
caught up in the violin playing. The lodgers, by contrast, who for
the moment had placed themselves, hands in their trouser pockets,
behind the music stand much too close to the sister, so that they
could all see the sheet music, something that must certainly bother
the sister, soon drew back to the window conversing in low voices
with bowed heads, where they then remained, worriedly observed by
the father. It now seemed really clear that, having assumed they
were to hear a beautiful or entertaining violin recital, they were
disappointed and were allowing their peace and quiet to be
disturbed only out of politeness. The way in which they all blew
the smoke from their cigars out of their noses and mouths in
particular led one to conclude that they were very irritated. And
yet his sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was turned to
the side, her gaze followed the score intently and sadly. Gregor
crept forward still a little further, keeping his head close
against the floor in order to be able to catch her gaze if
possible. Was he an animal that music so captivated him? For him it
was as if the way to the unknown nourishment he craved was
revealing itself. He was determined to press forward right to his
sister, to tug at her dress, and to indicate to her in this way
that she might still come with her violin into his room, because
here no one valued the recital as he wanted to value it. He did not
wish to let her go from his room any more, at least not as long as
he lived. His frightening appearance would for the first time
become useful for him. He wanted to be at all the doors of his room
simultaneously and snarl back at the attackers. However, his sister
should not be compelled but would remain with him voluntarily. She
would sit next to him on the sofa, bend down her ear to him, and he
would then confide in her that he firmly intended to send her to
the conservatory and that, if his misfortune had not arrived in the
interim, he would have declared all this last Christmas—had
Christmas really already come and gone?—and would have brooked no
argument. After this explanation his sister would break out in
tears of emotion, and Gregor would lift himself up to her armpit
and kiss her throat, which she, from the time she started going to
work, had left exposed without a band or a collar.</p>
<p>"Mr. Samsa," called out the middle lodger to the father and,
without uttering a further word, pointed his index finger at Gregor
as he was moving slowly forward. The violin fell silent. The middle
lodger smiled, first shaking his head once at his friends, and then
looked down at Gregor once more. Rather than driving Gregor back
again, the father seemed to consider it of prime importance to calm
down the lodgers, although they were not at all upset and Gregor
seemed to entertain them more than the violin recital. The father
hurried over to them and with outstretched arms tried to push them
into their own room and simultaneously to block their view of
Gregor with his own body. At this point they became really somewhat
irritated, although one no longer knew whether that was because of
the father's behaviour or because of knowledge they had just
acquired that they had, without knowing it, a neighbour like
Gregor. They demanded explanations from his father, raised their
arms to make their points, tugged agitatedly at their beards, and
moved back towards their room quite slowly. In the meantime, the
isolation which had suddenly fallen upon his sister after the
sudden breaking off of the recital had overwhelmed her. She had
held onto the violin and bow in her limp hands for a little while
and had continued to look at the sheet music as if she was still
playing. All at once she pulled herself together, placed the
instrument in her mother's lap—the mother was still sitting in her
chair having trouble breathing for her lungs were labouring—and had
run into the next room, which the lodgers, pressured by the father,
were already approaching more rapidly. One could observe how under
the sister's practiced hands the sheets and pillows on the beds
were thrown on high and arranged. Even before the lodgers had
reached the room, she was finished fixing the beds and was slipping
out. The father seemed so gripped once again with his stubbornness
that he forgot about the respect which he always owed to his
renters. He pressed on and on, until at the door of the room the
middle gentleman stamped loudly with his foot and thus brought the
father to a standstill. "I hereby declare," the middle lodger said,
raising his hand and casting his glance both on the mother and the
sister, "that considering the disgraceful conditions prevailing in
this apartment and family"—with this he spat decisively on the
floor—"I immediately cancel my room. I will, of course, pay nothing
at all for the days which I have lived here; on the contrary I
shall think about whether or not I will initiate some sort of
action against you, something which—believe me—will be very easy to
establish." He fell silent and looked directly in front of him, as
if he was waiting for something. In fact, his two friends
immediately joined in with their opinions, "We also give immediate
notice." At that he seized the door handle, banged the door shut,
and locked it.</p>
<p>The father groped his way tottering to his chair and let himself
fall in it. It looked as if he was stretching out for his usual
evening snooze, but the heavy nodding of his head, which looked as
if it was without support, showed that he was not sleeping at all.
Gregor had lain motionless the entire time in the spot where the
lodgers had caught him. Disappointment with the collapse of his
plan and perhaps also weakness brought on by his severe hunger made
it impossible for him to move. He was certainly afraid that a
general disaster would break over him at any moment, and he waited.
He was not even startled when the violin fell from the mother's
lap, out from under her trembling fingers, and gave off a
reverberating tone.</p>
<p>"My dear parents," said the sister banging her hand on the table
by way of an introduction, "things cannot go on any longer in this
way. Maybe if you don't understand that, well, I do. I will not
utter my brother's name in front of this monster, and thus I say
only that we must try to get rid of it. We have tried what is
humanly possible to take care of it and to be patient. I believe
that no one can criticize us in the slightest." "She is right in a
thousand ways," said the father to himself. The mother, who was
still incapable of breathing properly, began to cough numbly with
her hand held up over her mouth and a manic expression in her
eyes.</p>
<p>The sister hurried over to her mother and held her forehead. The
sister's words seemed to have led the father to certain
reflections. He sat upright, played with his uniform hat among the
plates, which still lay on the table from the lodgers' evening
meal, and looked now and then at the motionless Gregor.</p>
<p>"We must try to get rid of it," the sister now said decisively
to the father, for the mother, in her coughing fit, was not
listening to anything. "It is killing you both. I see it coming.
When people have to work as hard as we all do, they cannot also
tolerate this endless torment at home. I just can't go on any
more." And she broke out into such a crying fit that her tears
flowed out down onto her mother's face. She wiped them off her
mother with mechanical motions of her hands.</p>
<p>"Child," said the father sympathetically and with obvious
appreciation, "then what should we do?"</p>
<p>The sister only shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the
perplexity which, in contrast to her previous confidence, had come
over her while she was crying.</p>
<p>"If only he understood us," said the father in a
semi-questioning tone. The sister, in the midst of her sobbing,
shook her hand energetically as a sign that there was no point
thinking of that.</p>
<p>"If he only understood us," repeated the father and by shutting
his eyes he absorbed the sister's conviction of the impossibility
of this point, "then perhaps some compromise would be possible with
him. But as it is… "</p>
<p>"It must be gotten rid of," cried the sister. "That is the only
way, father. You must try to get rid of the idea that this is
Gregor. The fact that we have believed for so long, that is truly
our real misfortune. But how can it be Gregor? If it were Gregor,
he would have long ago realized that a communal life among human
beings is not possible with such an animal and would have gone away
voluntarily. Then we would not have a brother, but we could go on
living and honour his memory. But this animal plagues us. It drives
away the lodgers, will obviously take over the entire apartment,
and leave us to spend the night in the alley. Just look, father,"
she suddenly cried out, "he's already starting up again." With a
fright which was totally incomprehensible to Gregor, the sister
even left the mother, pushed herself away from her chair, as if she
would sooner sacrifice her mother than remain in Gregor's vicinity,
and rushed behind her father who, excited merely by her behaviour,
also stood up and half raised his arms in front of the sister as
though to protect her.</p>
<p>But Gregor did not have any notion of wishing to create problems
for anyone and certainly not for his sister. He had just started to
turn himself around in order to creep back into his room, quite a
startling sight, since, as a result of his suffering condition, he
had to guide himself through the difficulty of turning around with
his head, in this process lifting and banging it against the floor
several times. He paused and looked around. His good intentions
seem to have been recognized. The fright had lasted only for a
moment. Now they looked at him in silence and sorrow. His mother
lay in her chair, with her legs stretched out and pressed together;
her eyes were almost shut from weariness. The father and sister sat
next to one another. The sister had set her hands around the
father's neck.</p>
<p>"Now perhaps I can actually turn myself around," thought Gregor
and began the task again. He couldn't stop puffing at the effort
and had to rest now and then.</p>
<p>Besides, no one was urging him on. It was all left to him on his
own. When he had completed turning around, he immediately began to
wander straight back. He was astonished at the great distance which
separated him from his room and did not understand in the least how
in his weakness he had covered the same distance a short time
before, almost without noticing it. Constantly intent only on
creeping along quickly, he hardly paid any attention to the fact
that no word or cry from his family interrupted him.</p>
<p>Only when he was already in the door did he turn his head, not
completely, because he felt his neck growing stiff. At any rate he
still saw that behind him nothing had changed. Only the sister was
standing up. His last glimpse brushed over the mother who was now
completely asleep. Hardly was he inside his room when the door was
pushed shut very quickly, bolted fast, and barred. Gregor was
startled by the sudden commotion behind him, so much so that his
little limbs bent double under him. It was his sister who had been
in such a hurry. She had stood up right away, had waited, and had
then sprung forward nimbly. Gregor had not heard anything of her
approach. She cried out "Finally!" to her parents, as she turned
the key in the lock.</p>
<p>"What now?" Gregor asked himself and looked around him in the
darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move
at all. He was not surprised at that. On the contrary, it struck
him as unnatural that up to this point he had really been able up
to move around with these thin little legs. Besides he felt
relatively content. True, he had pains throughout his entire body,
but it seemed to him that they were gradually becoming weaker and
weaker and would finally go away completely. The rotten apple in
his back and the inflamed surrounding area, entirely covered with
white dust, he hardly noticed. He remembered his family with deep
feelings of love. In this business, his own thought that he had to
disappear was, if possible, even more decisive than his sister's.
He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until
the tower clock struck three o'clock in the morning. From the
window he witnessed the beginning of the general dawning outside.
Then without willing it, his head sank all the way down, and from
his nostrils flowed out weakly his last breath.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the cleaning woman came. In her sheer
energy and haste she banged all the doors—in precisely the way
people had already asked her to avoid—so much so that once she
arrived a quiet sleep was no longer possible anywhere in the entire
apartment. In her customarily brief visit to Gregor she at first
found nothing special. She thought he lay so immobile there because
he wanted to play the offended party. She gave him credit for as
complete an understanding as possible. Since she happened to be
holding the long broom in her hand, she tried to tickle Gregor with
it from the door. When that was quite unsuccessful, she became
irritated and poked Gregor a little, and only when she had shoved
him from his place without any resistance did she become attentive.
When she quickly realized the true state of affairs, her eyes grew
large, she whistled to herself. However, she didn't restrain
herself for long. She pulled open the door of the bedroom and
yelled in a loud voice into the darkness, "Come and look. It's
kicked the bucket. It's lying there, totally snuffed!"</p>
<p>The Samsa married couple sat upright in their marriage bed and
had to get over their fright at the cleaning woman before they
managed to grasp her message. But then Mr. and Mrs. Samsa climbed
very quickly out of bed, one on either side. Mr. Samsa threw the
bedspread over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her
night-shirt, and like this they stepped into Gregor's room.
Meanwhile, the door of the living room, in which Grete had slept
since the lodgers had arrived on the scene, had also opened. She
was fully clothed, as if she had not slept at all; her white face
also seem to indicate that. "Dead?" said Mrs. Samsa and looked
questioningly at the cleaning woman, although she could check
everything on her own and even understand without a check. "I
should say so," said the cleaning woman and, by way of proof, poked
Gregor's body with the broom a considerable distance more to the
side. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wished to restrain the
broom, but didn't do it. "Well," said Mr. Samsa, "now we can give
thanks to God." He crossed himself, and the three women followed
his example.</p>
<p>Grete, who did not take her eyes off the corpse, said, "Look how
thin he was. He had eaten nothing for such a long time. The meals
which came in here came out again exactly the same." In fact,
Gregor's body was completely flat and dry. That was apparent really
for the first time, now that he was no longer raised on his small
limbs and nothing else distracted one's gaze.</p>
<p>"Grete, come into us for a moment," said Mrs. Samsa with a
melancholy smile, and Grete went, not without looking back at the
corpse, behind her parents into the bed room. The cleaning woman
shut the door and opened the window wide. In spite of the early
morning, the fresh air was partly tinged with warmth. It was
already the end of March.</p>
<p>The three lodgers stepped out of their room and looked around
for their breakfast, astonished that they had been forgotten.
"Where is the breakfast?" asked the middle one of the gentlemen
grumpily to the cleaning woman. However, she laid her finger to her
lips and then quickly and silently indicated to the lodgers that
they could come into Gregor's room. So they came and stood in the
room, which was already quite bright, around Gregor's corpse, their
hands in the pockets of their somewhat worn jackets.</p>
<p>Then the door of the bed room opened, and Mr. Samsa appeared in
his uniform, with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the
other. All were a little tear stained. Now and then Grete pressed
her face onto her father's arm.</p>
<p>"Get out of my apartment immediately," said Mr. Samsa and pulled
open the door, without letting go of the women. "What do you mean?"
said the middle lodger, somewhat dismayed and with a sugary smile.
The two others kept their hands behind them and constantly rubbed
them against each other, as if in joyful anticipation of a great
squabble which must end up in their favour. "I mean exactly what I
say," replied Mr. Samsa and went directly with his two female
companions up to the lodger. The latter at first stood there
motionless and looked at the floor, as if matters were arranging
themselves in a new way in his head. "All right, then we'll go," he
said and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if, suddenly overcome by
humility, he was asking fresh permission for this decision. Mr.
Samsa merely nodded to him repeatedly with his eyes open wide.</p>
<p>Following that, the lodger actually went with long strides
immediately out into the hall. His two friends had already been
listening for a while with their hands quite still, and now they
hopped smartly after him, as if afraid that Mr. Samsa could step
into the hall ahead of them and disturb their reunion with their
leader. In the hall all three of them took their hats from the coat
rack, pulled their canes from the cane holder, bowed silently, and
left the apartment. In what turned out to be an entirely groundless
mistrust, Mr. Samsa stepped with the two women out onto the
landing, leaned against the railing, and looked over as the three
lodgers slowly but steadily made their way down the long staircase,
disappeared on each floor in a certain turn of the stairwell, and
in a few seconds came out again. The deeper they proceeded, the
more the Samsa family lost interest in them, and when a butcher
with a tray on his head come to meet them and then with a proud
bearing ascended the stairs high above them, Mr. Samsa, together
with the women, left the banister, and they all returned, as if
relieved, back into their apartment.</p>
<p>They decided to pass that day resting and going for a stroll.
Not only had they earned this break from work, but there was no
question that they really needed it. And so they sat down at the
table and wrote three letters of apology: Mr. Samsa to his
supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and Grete to her proprietor.
During the writing the cleaning woman came in to say that she was
going off, for her morning work was finished. The three people
writing at first merely nodded, without glancing up. Only when the
cleaning woman was still unwilling to depart, did they look up
angrily. "Well?" asked Mr. Samsa. The cleaning woman stood smiling
in the doorway, as if she had a great stroke of luck to report to
the family but would only do it if she was asked directly. The
almost upright small ostrich feather in her hat, which had
irritated Mr. Samsa during her entire service, swayed lightly in
all directions. "All right then, what do you really want?" asked
Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady still usually respected. "Well,"
answered the cleaning woman, smiling so happily she couldn't go on
speaking right away, "about how that rubbish from the next room
should be thrown out, you mustn't worry about it. It's all taken
care of." Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down to their letters, as
though they wanted to go on writing. Mr. Samsa, who noticed that
the cleaning woman wanted to start describing everything in detail,
decisively prevented her with an outstretched hand. But since she
was not allowed to explain, she remembered the great hurry she was
in, and called out, clearly insulted, "Bye bye, everyone," turned
around furiously and left the apartment with a fearful slamming of
the door.</p>
<p>"This evening she'll be let go," said Mr. Samsa, but he got no
answer from either his wife or from his daughter, because the
cleaning woman seemed to have upset once again the tranquillity
they had just attained. They got up, went to the window, and
remained there, with their arms about each other. Mr. Samsa turned
around in his chair in their direction and observed them quietly
for a while. Then he called out, "All right, come here then. Let's
finally get rid of old things. And have a little consideration for
me." The women attended to him at once. They rushed to him,
caressed him, and quickly ended their letters.</p>
<p>Then all three left the apartment together, something they had
not done for months now, and took the electric tram into the open
air outside the city. The car in which they were sitting by
themselves was totally engulfed by the warm sun. Leaning back
comfortably in their seats, they talked to each other about future
prospects, and they discovered that on closer observation these
were not at all bad, for the three of them had employment, about
which they had not really questioned each other at all, which was
extremely favourable and with especially promising prospects. The
greatest improvement in their situation at this moment, of course,
had to come from a change of dwelling. Now they wanted to rent an
apartment smaller and cheaper but better situated and generally
more practical than the present one, which Gregor had found. While
they amused themselves in this way, it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa,
almost at the same moment, how their daughter, who was getting more
animated all the time, had blossomed recently, in spite of all the
troubles which had made her cheeks pale, into a beautiful and
voluptuous young woman. Growing more silent and almost
unconsciously understanding each other in their glances, they
thought that the time was now at hand to seek out a good honest man
for her. And it was something of a confirmation of their new dreams
and good intentions when at the end of their journey their daughter
got up first and stretched her young body.</p>
