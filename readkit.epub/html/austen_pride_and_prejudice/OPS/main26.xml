<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter a week spent
in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was
called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The
pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by
preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to
hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took
leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as
before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and
promised their father another letter of thanks.</p>
<p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of
receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the
Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike
man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as
education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in
believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own
warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs.
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs.
Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great
favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and
herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had
frequently been staying with her in town.</p>
<p>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this
was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to
listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to
complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her
sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and
after all there was nothing in it.</p>
<p>"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got
Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to
think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had
it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this
very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady
Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the
Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are
very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can
get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very
nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have
neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However,
your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am
very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given
before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with
her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her
nieces, turned the conversation.</p>
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the
subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,"
said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so
often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily
falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident
separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of
inconsistencies are very frequent."</p>
<p>"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it
will not do for&#160;<em>us</em>. We do not suffer
by&#160;<em>accident</em>. It does not often happen that the
interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent
fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love
with only a few days before."</p>
<p>"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is
as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray,
how&#160;<em>violent was</em>&#160;Mr. Bingley's love?"</p>
<p>"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every
time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball
he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance;
and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could
there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence
of love?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she
may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened
to&#160;<em>you</em>, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of
it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back
with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little
relief from home may be as useful as anything."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt
persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.</p>
<p>"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with
regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so
different a part of town, all our connections are so different,
and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very
improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to
see her."</p>
<p>"And&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;is quite impossible; for he is now
in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer
him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how
could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps
have&#160;<em>heard</em>&#160;of such a place as Gracechurch
Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to
cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and
depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."</p>
<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does
not Jane correspond with his sister?&#160;<em>She</em>&#160;will
not be able to help calling."</p>
<p>"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."</p>
<p>But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to
place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of
Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on
the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not
consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she
thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and
the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more
natural influence of Jane's attractions.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and
the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time,
than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with
her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her,
without any danger of seeing him.</p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the
Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day
without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for
the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once
sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some
of the officers always made part of it—of which officers Mr.
Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner,
rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly
observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to
be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain
enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to
Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and
represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an
attachment.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years
ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that
very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore,
many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little
there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to
give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had
been in the way of procuring.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy
by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley
with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in
bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late
possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made
acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried
to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite
a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she
recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of
as a very proud, ill-natured boy.</p>
