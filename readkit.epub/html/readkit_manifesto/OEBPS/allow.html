                        <ul>
                            <li>provide publishers with a freely-available and easy means of serving their readers with truly responsive and attractive eBook content from their own website, on their own terms</li>
                            <li>allow publishers to have more control over consistent presentation of their content.</li>
                            <li>allow publishers to easily provide a customised reading experience for a given title.</li>
                            <li>provide publishers with a means of embedding a reading system inside an EPUB file, and thereby letting it travel with the eBook. By doing this, publishers can ensure that their content is displayed faithfully when viewed in a modern web browser, but also remain valid and work conventionallly in existing vendor EPUB reading systems</li>
                            <li>allow publishers to easily tap into advances in web standards and browser technology</li>
                            <li>provide a reading system which is tailored for use on mobile devices, but also works well in desktop browsers.</li>
                            <li>allow publishers to reach a wider audience using a single content file</li>

                        <h4>Consistent presentation of content</h4>
                        <p>Although there exist different makes of web browsers, browser manufacturers (including Microsoft with Internet Explorer 10+) are doing a good job of standardising on the implementation of web technologies, such that consistent presentation of content is typically easier to acheive than it is with vendor reading systems.</p>

                        <p>Using technologies such as CSS media queries, it is possible to produce a single EPUB file of content which will work well across a range of different device sizes, from smartphones to desktop displays.</p>

                        <h4>A customised reading experience</h4>
                        <p>As Readk.it travels within the EPUB file, the reading experience can be customised as necessary for each title.</p>
                        <p>Through the use of media queries, different features can be presented for a given screen size; for instance, content can be presented more simply on a smartphone screen than on a tablet or desktop display, with certain content elements being hidden or presented in a simplified fashion.</p>

                        <h4>Tap into advances in browser technology</h4>
                        <p>As Readk.it is browser-based, when web browsers adopt newer features, these are immediately available for use by the content publisher.</p>

                        <p>Contrast this with the many vendor reading systems that provide only slow and fitful uptake of technology advances.</p>

                                    Web fonts allow us to apply traditional typographic practices to eBook publishing. With an ever-expanding range of fonts available for embedding in eBooks, along with with improvements in CSS and innovations using JavaScript, digital typography is coming of age.

                                <p>Web-based typography can be <a rel="external" href="http://webtypographyforthelonely.com/">truly striking and innovative</a>, and although there are still areas needing further development, <a rel="external" href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-look-that-says-book">others are coming along nicely</a>. In fact, with the <a rel="external" href="http://alistapart.com/article/building-books-with-css3">CSS3 Paged Media Module</a>, we&#8217;ll soon be experiencing web technologies being used for typsetting books intended for print.

                        <h4>Searchable metadata</h4>
                        <p>EPUBs can contain significant amounts of rich metadata about the publication. Conventionally, this metadata is locked up in the EPUB file. However when web-serving publications, Readk.it can retrieve this metadata and embed it in the web-served publication such that is discoverable by search engines.
                        </p>

                        <p>What&#8217;s more, with the advent of metadata standards such as <a rel="external" href="http://schema.org/">schema.org&#8217;s</a> use of the microdata-based <a rel="external" href="http://schema.org/Book">Book schema</a>, metadata can be presented to search engines that are specifically looking for information in the context of a book.

                                    Appropriate metadata helps to ensure that the reader can find the content, and once having found it, navigate easily and appropriately through the content.
                                </p>
                                <p>Discoverability of content is becoming one of the crucial requirements of online publishing, and first and foremost this means ensuring that search engines such as Google know how to find your content.
