<div class="text">
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">"M</span>y dear Lizzy,
where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth
received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all
the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor
anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>
<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were
silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows
in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused,
rather&#160;<em>knew</em>&#160;that she was happy
than&#160;<em>felt</em>&#160;herself to be so; for, besides the
immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She
anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation
became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and
even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his
fortune and consequence might do away.</p>
<p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very
far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely
incredulous here.</p>
<p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy!
No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."</p>
<p>"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on
you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet,
indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still
loves me, and we are engaged."</p>
<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know
how much you dislike him."</p>
<p>"You know nothing of the matter.&#160;<em>That</em>&#160;is all
to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do
now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and
more seriously assured her of its truth.</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"
cried Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but
are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that
you can be happy with him?"</p>
<p>"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us
already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But
are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"</p>
<p>"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself
more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.
And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do
anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure
that you feel what you ought to do?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I
feel&#160;<em>more</em>&#160;than I ought to do, when I tell you
all."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I
am afraid you will be angry."</p>
<p>"My dearest sister, now&#160;<em>be</em>&#160;serious. I want to
talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know,
without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"</p>
<p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it
began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his
beautiful grounds at Pemberley."</p>
<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced
the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn
assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss
Bennet had nothing further to wish.</p>
<p>"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as
myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his
love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's
friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself
more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved
with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and
Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been
unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own
feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now
she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage.
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the
next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here
again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome
as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go
a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his
company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with
him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a
proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always
giving him such an epithet.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,
and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good
information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have
you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again
to-day?"</p>
<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet,
"to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and
Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."</p>
<p>"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but
I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty
owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed
her, saying:</p>
<p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it:
it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for
talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself
to inconvenience."</p>
<p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent
should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to
herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine
how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his
wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of
the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or
violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would
be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no
more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy,
than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,
she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on
seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition,
but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through
her means—that&#160;<em>she</em>, his favourite child, should be
distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and
regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and she sat
in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she
was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached
the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending
to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants
you in the library." She was gone directly.</p>
<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and
anxious. "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your
senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated
him?"</p>
<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had
been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have
spared her from explanations and professions which it was
exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she
assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr.
Darcy.</p>
<p>"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,
to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages
than Jane. But will they make you happy?"</p>
<p>"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your
belief of my indifference?"</p>
<p>"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of
man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."</p>
<p>"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I
love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable.
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by
speaking of him in such terms."</p>
<p>"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is
the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse
anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it
to&#160;<em>you</em>, if you are resolved on having him. But let me
advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I
know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you
truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a
superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest
danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit
and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of
seeing&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;unable to respect your partner in
life. You know not what you are about."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her
reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was
really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change
which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute
certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had
stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with
energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's
incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.</p>
<p>"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no
more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have
parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."</p>
<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what
Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with
astonishment.</p>
<p>"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every
thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts,
and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a
world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I
must and&#160;<em>would</em>&#160;have paid him; but these violent
young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay
him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and
there will be an end of the matter."</p>
<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his
reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time,
allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, "If any
young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at
leisure."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,
after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able
to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too
recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there
was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of
ease and familiarity would come in time.</p>
<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she
followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was
most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite
still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many
minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in
general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her
family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She
began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up,
sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!
Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest
Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what
jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to
it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming
man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my
having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it.
Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming!
Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will
become of me. I shall go distracted."</p>
<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be
doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard
only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three
minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.</p>
<p>"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And
a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special
licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is
particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."</p>
<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the
gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the
certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her
relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But
the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that
she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to
offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains
to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he
was rising every hour in his esteem.</p>
<p>"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham,
perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall
like&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;husband quite as well as Jane's."</p>
