<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>heir sister's
wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably
more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them
at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival
was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had
she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her
sister must endure.</p>
<p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to
receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage
drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her
daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.</p>
<p>Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown
open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,
embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an
affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished
them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their
happiness.</p>
<p>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was
not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;
and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young
couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted,
and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed,
unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to
sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they
all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some
little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a
great while since she had been there.</p>
<p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his
manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his
marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy
address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted
them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such
assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no
limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed,
and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their
confusion suffered no variation of colour.</p>
<p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could
neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit
near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that
neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable
to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the
happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected
with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters
would not have alluded to for the world.</p>
<p>"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went
away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been
things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went
away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came
back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I
was."</p>
<p>Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth
looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw
anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh!
mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was
afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his
curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down
the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand
just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and
then I bowed and smiled like anything."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of
the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through
the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to
see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand,
and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place
now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that
embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her
ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips,
the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself
called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she
went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to
Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</p>
<p>"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the
breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a
charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope
they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That
is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not
all go."</p>
<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia,
I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"</p>
<p>"Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be
some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them
all."</p>
<p>"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.</p>
<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my
sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them
before the winter is over."</p>
<p>"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I
do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."</p>
<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.
Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he
was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</p>
<p>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so
short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her
daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties
were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more
desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.</p>
<p>Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had
expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely
needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of
things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of
her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why,
without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at
all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered
necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case,
he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a
companion.</p>
<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on
every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He
did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill
more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the
country.</p>
<p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with
her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:</p>
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;an account of my
wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the
others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was
managed?"</p>
<p>"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too
little said on the subject."</p>
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We
were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's
lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all
be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go
together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,
Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you
know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should
have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I
was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading
a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was
thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know
whether he would be married in his blue coat."</p>
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would
never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my
uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors,
though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or
anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the
Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to
the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man
Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there
is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to
do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the
hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I
recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as
well."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But
gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about
it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to
be such a secret!"</p>
<p>"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on
the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."</p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;
"we will ask you no questions."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly
tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."</p>
<p>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out
of her power, by running away.</p>
<p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at
least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had
been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly
among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least
temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and
wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest
light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense;
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her
aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were
compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.</p>
<p>"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must
be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and
(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been
amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me
understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in
the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must
endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."</p>
<p>"Not that I&#160;<em>shall</em>, though," she added to herself,
as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell
me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks
and stratagems to find it out."</p>
<p>Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.</p>
