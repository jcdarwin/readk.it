<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he ladies of
Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon
returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking
to, a wish of being better acquainted
with&#160;<em>them</em>&#160;was expressed towards the two eldest.
By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure,
but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like
them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as
arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's
admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that
he&#160;<em>did</em>&#160;admire her and to<em>her</em>&#160;it was
equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she
had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to
be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was
not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend
Miss Lucas.</p>
<p>"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to
impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her
affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose
the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor
consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so
much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is
not safe to leave any to itself. We can
all&#160;<em>begin</em>&#160;freely—a slight preference is natural
enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be
really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a
women had better show&#160;<em>more</em>&#160;affection than she
feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do
more than like her, if she does not help him on."</p>
<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If
I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed,
not to discover it too."</p>
<p>"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as
you do."</p>
<p>"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he must find it out."</p>
<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley
and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together;
and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is
impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing
together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in
which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him,
there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she
chooses."</p>
<p>"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is
in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were
determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I
should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not
acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree
of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only
a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw
him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in
company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand
his character."</p>
<p>"Not as you represent it. Had she
merely&#160;<em>dined</em>&#160;with him, she might only have
discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember
that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings
may do a great deal."</p>
<p>"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that
they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to
any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has
been unfolded."</p>
<p>"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart;
and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as
good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his
character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a
matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so
well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not
advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow
sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and
it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the
person with whom you are to pass your life."</p>
<p>"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it
is not sound, and that you would never act in this way
yourself."</p>
<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister,
Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an
object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at
first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her
without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked
at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to
himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her
face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent
by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery
succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected
with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in
her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not
those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy
playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only
the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought
her handsome enough to dance with.</p>
<p>He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards
conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with
others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William
Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.</p>
<p>"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening
to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"</p>
<p>"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."</p>
<p>"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that
I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do
not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of
him."</p>
<p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming
to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to
mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking
Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:</p>
<p>"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself
uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to
give us a ball at Meryton?"</p>
<p>"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a
lady energetic."</p>
<p>"You are severe on us."</p>
<p>"It will be&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;turn soon to be teased," said
Miss Lucas. "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know
what follows."</p>
<p>"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always
wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my
vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;
but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who
must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss
Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well, if it must be
so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine
old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep
your breath to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell
my song."</p>
<p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After
a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of
several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the
instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being
the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and
accomplishments, was always impatient for display.</p>
<p>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given
her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and
conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of
excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,
had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing
half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to
purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the
request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and
two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the
room.</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode
of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and
was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William
Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:</p>
<p>"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!
There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of
the first refinements of polished society."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can
dance."</p>
<p>Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I
doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.
Darcy."</p>
<p>"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the
sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?"</p>
<p>"Never, sir."</p>
<p>"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the
place?"</p>
<p>"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can
avoid it."</p>
<p>"You have a house in town, I conclude?"</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy bowed.</p>
<p>"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am
fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the
air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."</p>
<p>He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not
disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards
them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing,
and called out to her:</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you
must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable
partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty
is before you." And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.
Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive
it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure
to Sir William:</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I
entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg
for a partner."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the
honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did
Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at
persuasion.</p>
<p>"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to
deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman
dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am
sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.</p>
<p>"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss
Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object to
such a partner?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with
some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:</p>
<p>"I can guess the subject of your reverie."</p>
<p>"I should imagine not."</p>
<p>"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of
your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those
people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"</p>
<p>"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was
more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great
pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman
can bestow."</p>
<p>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired
he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such
reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:</p>
<p>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."</p>
<p>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all
astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray,
when am I to wish you joy?"</p>
<p>"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A
lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love,
from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me
joy."</p>
<p>"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter
is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law,
indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with
you."</p>
<p>He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced
her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.</p>
