<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he day passed
much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had
spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued,
though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their
party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was
watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his
attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were
at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</p>
<p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused
in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The
perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or
on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with
the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed
a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of
each.</p>
<p>"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"</p>
<p>He made no answer.</p>
<p>"You write uncommonly fast."</p>
<p>"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."</p>
<p>"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course
of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think
them!"</p>
<p>"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of
yours."</p>
<p>"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."</p>
<p>"I have already told her so once, by your desire."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I
mend pens remarkably well."</p>
<p>"Thank you—but I always mend my own."</p>
<p>"How can you contrive to write so even?"</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on
the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with
her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely
superior to Miss Grantley's."</p>
<p>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write
again? At present I have not room to do them justice."</p>
<p>"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do
you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"</p>
<p>"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not
for me to determine."</p>
<p>"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter
with ease, cannot write ill."</p>
<p>"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried
her brother, "because he does&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;write with
ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you,
Darcy?"</p>
<p>"My style of writing is very different from yours."</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless
way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the
rest."</p>
<p>"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express
them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to
my correspondents."</p>
<p>"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm
reproof."</p>
<p>"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes
an indirect boast."</p>
<p>"And which of the two do you call&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;little
recent piece of modesty?"</p>
<p>"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without
any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told
Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting
Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be
a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is
there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very
necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to
yourself or anyone else?"</p>
<p>"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night
all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon
my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I
believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume
the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before
the ladies."</p>
<p>"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite
as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you
were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had
better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would
probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month."</p>
<p>"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.
Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown
him off now much more than he did himself."</p>
<p>"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting
what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my
temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that
gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think
better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat
denial, and ride off as fast as I could."</p>
<p>"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original
intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"</p>
<p>"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must
speak for himself."</p>
<p>"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call
mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,
however, to stand according to your representation, you must
remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire
his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely
desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its
propriety."</p>
<p>"To yield readily—easily—to the&#160;<em>persuasion</em>&#160;of
a friend is no merit with you."</p>
<p>"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the
understanding of either."</p>
<p>"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence
of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often
make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments
to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a
case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait,
perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the
discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary
cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by
the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should
you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without
waiting to be argued into it?"</p>
<p>"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which
is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy
subsisting between the parties?"</p>
<p>"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars,
not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will
have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be
aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall
fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so
much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than
Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his
own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing
to do."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that
he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss
Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an
expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.</p>
<p>"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and
Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be
very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."</p>
<p>"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and
Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>
<p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and
Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with
some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that
Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more
earnestly negatived, she seated herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus
employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over
some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.
Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that
she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet
that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more
strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his
notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible,
according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.
The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care
for his approbation.</p>
<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm
by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:</p>
<p>"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such
an opportunity of dancing a reel?"</p>
<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with
some surprise at her silence.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say
'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but
I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and
cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,
therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance
a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare."</p>
<p>"Indeed I do not dare."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at
his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in
her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and
Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He
really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her
connections, he should be in some danger.</p>
<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her
great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received
some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by
talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in
such an alliance.</p>
<p>"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the
shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few
hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage
of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the
younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so
delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,
bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady
possesses."</p>
<p>"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic
felicity?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips
be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your
great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,
only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must
not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those
beautiful eyes?"</p>
<p>"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but
their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,
might be copied."</p>
<p>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.</p>
<p>"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley,
in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.</p>
<p>"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away
without telling us that you were coming out."</p>
<p>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth
to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt
their rudeness, and immediately said:</p>
<p>"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go
into the avenue."</p>
<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with
them, laughingly answered:</p>
<p>"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and
appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by
admitting a fourth. Good-bye."</p>
<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the
hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so
much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours
that evening.</p>
