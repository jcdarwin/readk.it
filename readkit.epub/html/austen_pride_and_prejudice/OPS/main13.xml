<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">"I</span>&#160;hope, my
dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the
next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because
I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."</p>
<p>"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am
sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I
hope&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;dinners are good enough for her. I do
not believe she often sees such at home."</p>
<p>"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is
Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad
to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit
of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must
speak to Hill this moment."</p>
<p>"It is&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;Mr. Bingley," said her husband;
"it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my
life."</p>
<p>This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of
being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at
once.</p>
<p>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:</p>
<p>"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight
ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and
requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
pleases."</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that
mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is
the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed
away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I
should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."</p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an
entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a
subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and
she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an
estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man
whom nobody cared anything about.</p>
<p>"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet,
"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting
Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be
a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."</p>
<p>"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very
impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I
hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with
you, as his father did before him?"</p>
<p>"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on
that head, as you will hear."</p>
<p>"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.</p>
<p>"Dear Sir,—</p>
<p>"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late
honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have
had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal
the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,
fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
at variance.—'There, Mrs. Bennet.'—My mind, however, is now made up
on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have
been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the
Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de
Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly
commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side,
and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends—but
of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me
into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday
se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as
Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
duty of the day.—I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,</p>
<p>"WILLIAM COLLINS"</p>
<p>"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making
gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems
to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and
I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady
Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us
again."</p>
<p>"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,
and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the
person to discourage him."</p>
<p>"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he
can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is
certainly to his credit."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for
Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,
and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.</p>
<p>"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him
out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose
he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?"</p>
<p>"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him
quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and
self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient
to see him."</p>
<p>"In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new,
yet I think it is well expressed."</p>
<p>To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were
in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their
cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks
since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any
other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done
away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a
degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with
great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said
little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins
seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent
himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He
had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on
having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of
their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of
the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in
due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to
the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled
with no compliments, answered most readily.</p>
<p>"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it
may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are
settled so oddly."</p>
<p>"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."</p>
<p>"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,
you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault
with&#160;<em>you</em>, for such things I know are all chance in
this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they
come to be entailed."</p>
<p>"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,
and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of
appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young
ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not
say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—"</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled
on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's
admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were
examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have
touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of
his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in
its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his
fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was
set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity
that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her
daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for
having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not
at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter
of an hour.</p>
