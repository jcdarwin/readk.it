The Pipe</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and
also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting
the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.</p>
<p>In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings
were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How
could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones,
without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of
the plank, and a king of the sea and a great lord of Leviathans was
Ahab.</p>
<p>Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his
mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his
face. “How now,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube,
“this smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with
me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling,
not pleasuring— aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the
while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the
dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of
trouble. What business have I with this pipe? This thing that is
meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white
hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I’ll smoke no
more-”</p>
<p>He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed
in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the
sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the
planks.</p>
