Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated
in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would
now be renewed.</p>
<p>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the
saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view
of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks
and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate
lawn.</p>
<p>In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting
there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she
lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but
attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from
shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who
felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and
reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice,
and pitied her.</p>
<p>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a
curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such
pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first
broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose
endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more
truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was
carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough
to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when
there was least danger of its being heard.</p>
<p>Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss
Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss
Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not
have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not
been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were
employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen
would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the
house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it
most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a
quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth
was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of
her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and
the others said no more.</p>
<p>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by
the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all
the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after
many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy
had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment
for the whole party—for though they could not all talk, they could
all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and
peaches soon collected them round the table.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding
whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy,
by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then,
though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to
predominate, she began to regret that he came.</p>
<p>He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three
other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had
left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a
visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than
Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a
resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more
easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party
were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye
which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in
Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face
whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet
made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no
means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself
much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his
sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as
possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger,
took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:</p>
<p>"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from
Meryton? They must be a great loss
to&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;family."</p>
<p>In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but
Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her
thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her
a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the
ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a
tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance
showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking
at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift
up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving
her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the
hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by
bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her
partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the
follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were
connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of
Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been
revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from
all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to
conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago
attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had
certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should
effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is
probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the
welfare of his friend.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his
emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not
approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,
though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose
eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the
affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn
his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more
and more cheerfully.</p>
<p>Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not
join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her
favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such
terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of
finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned
to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some
part of what she had been saying to his sister.</p>
<p>"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"
she cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is
since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I
were agreeing that we should not have known her again."</p>
<p>However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he
contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other
alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence
of travelling in the summer.</p>
<p>"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never
could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion
has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her
nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her
teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her
eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see
anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look,
which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a
self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."</p>
<p>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this
was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people
are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat
nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely
silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she
continued:</p>
<p>"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed
we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I
particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been
dining at Netherfield, '<em>She</em>&#160;a beauty!—I should as
soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve
on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one
time."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer,
"but&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;was only when I first saw her, for it
is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest
women of my acquaintance."</p>
<p>He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the
satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain
but herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred
during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly
interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had
seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged
their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house,
his fruit—of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to
know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would
have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the
subject.</p>
