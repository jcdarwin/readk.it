<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t five o'clock
the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was
summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in,
and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much
superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on
hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were
grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how
excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no
more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not
immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all
her former dislike.</p>
<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she
could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was
evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they
prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed
she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from
any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister
scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he
was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at
cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout,
had nothing to say to her.</p>
<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss
Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her
manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride
and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.
Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:</p>
<p>"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an
excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning.
She really looked almost wild."</p>
<p>"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;be
scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her
hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six
inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had
been let down to hide it not doing its office."</p>
<p>"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but
this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked
remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty
petticoat quite escaped my notice."</p>
<p>"<em>You</em>&#160;observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss
Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to
see&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;sister make such an exhibition."</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever
it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could
she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of
conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to
decorum."</p>
<p>"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,"
said Bingley.</p>
<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half
whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration
of her fine eyes."</p>
<p>"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the
exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began
again:</p>
<p>"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really
a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well
settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low
connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."</p>
<p>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on
Meryton."</p>
<p>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near
Cheapside."</p>
<p>"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed
heartily.</p>
<p>"If they had uncles enough to
fill&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would
not make them one jot less agreeable."</p>
<p>"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men
of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.</p>
<p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it
their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the
expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.</p>
<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room
on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to
coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her
at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of
seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than
pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the
drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately
invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she
declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse
herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr.
Hurst looked at her with astonishment.</p>
<p>"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather
singular."</p>
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is
a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."</p>
<p>"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried
Elizabeth; "I am&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;a great reader, and I have
pleasure in many things."</p>
<p>"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said
Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite
well."</p>
<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards
the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to
fetch her others—all that his library afforded.</p>
<p>"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my
own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I
have more than I ever looked into."</p>
<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with
those in the room.</p>
<p>"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should
have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library
you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"</p>
<p>"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."</p>
<p>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always
buying books."</p>
<p>"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such
days as these."</p>
<p>"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the
beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you
build&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;house, I wish it may be half as
delightful as Pemberley."</p>
<p>"I wish it may."</p>
<p>"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not
a finer county in England than Derbyshire."</p>
<p>"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will
sell it."</p>
<p>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her
very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly
aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between
Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.</p>
<p>"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley;
"will she be as tall as I am?"</p>
<p>"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's
height, or rather taller."</p>
<p>"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who
delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so
extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the
pianoforte is exquisite."</p>
<p>"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have
patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."</p>
<p>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you
mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover
screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all
this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the
first time, without being informed that she was very
accomplished."</p>
<p>"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy,
"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who
deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a
screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation
of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than
half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are
really accomplished."</p>
<p>"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.</p>
<p>"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in
your idea of an accomplished woman."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."</p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be
really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is
usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the
word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in
her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address
and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved."</p>
<p>"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she
must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her
mind by extensive reading."</p>
<p>"I am no longer surprised at your
knowing&#160;<em>only</em>&#160;six accomplished women. I rather
wonder now at your knowing&#160;<em>any</em>."</p>
<p>"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility
of all this?"</p>
<p>"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste,
and application, and elegance, as you describe united."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice
of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many
women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to
order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was
going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth
soon afterwards left the room.</p>
<p>"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed
on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend
themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with
many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a
paltry device, a very mean art."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly
addressed, "there is a meanness in&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;the arts
which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."</p>
<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.</p>
<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was
worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones
being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no
country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to
town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not
hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their
brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be
sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly
better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that
they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by
duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his
feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.</p>
