caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first
favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly
telling her what she thought, she thus went on:</p>
<p>"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely
because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid
of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.
Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection
which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have
nothing to say against&#160;<em>him</em>; he is a most interesting
young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should
think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your
fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to
use it. Your father would depend
on&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;resolution and good conduct, I am sure.
You must not disappoint your father."</p>
<p>"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."</p>
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care
of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me,
if I can prevent it."</p>
<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in
love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond
all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes
really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should
not. I see the imprudence of it.
Oh!&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's
opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be
miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr.
Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the
means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that
where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by
immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each
other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my
fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore,
is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself
his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be
wishing. In short, I will do my best."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so
very often. At least, you should not&#160;<em>remind</em>&#160;your
mother of inviting him."</p>
<p>"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:
"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain
from&#160;<em>that</em>. But do not imagine that he is always here
so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently
invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity
of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I
hope you are satisfied."</p>
<p>Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked
her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful
instance of advice being given on such a point, without being
resented.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been
quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with
the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet.
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far
resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in
an ill-natured tone, that she "<em>wished</em>&#160;they might be
happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss
Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave,
Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good
wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the
room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:</p>
<p>"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."</p>
<p>"<em>That</em>&#160;you certainly shall."</p>
<p>"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see
me?"</p>
<p>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."</p>
<p>"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,
therefore, to come to Hunsford."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure
in the visit.</p>
<p>"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added
Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed,
Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them."</p>
<p>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for
Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to
hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her
friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it
had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the
comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken
as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather
than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good
deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she
would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and
how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the
letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself
on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote
cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood,
and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour
was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of
Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived
that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.</p>
<p>Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce
their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth
hoped it would be in her power to say something of the
Bingleys.</p>
<p>Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as
impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without
either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,
however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from
Longbourn had by some accident been lost.</p>
<p>"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of
the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor
Street."</p>
<p>She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss
Bingley. "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words,
"but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her
no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last
letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of
course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they
scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to
dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline
and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon
here."</p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in
town.</p>
<p>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She
endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she
could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After
waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every
evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but
the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her
manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter
which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she
felt.</p>
<p>"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have
been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my
dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour
was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at
all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but
if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she
did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she
made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a
word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I
cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as
she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and
though&#160;<em>we</em>know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet
if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me;
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she
must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but
wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he
had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of
my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself;
and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted
to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I
should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance
of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every
painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your
affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his
never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but
not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am
extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our
friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours,
etc."</p>
<p>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned
as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister
at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.
She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His
character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him,
as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he
might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's
account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown
away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than
to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions
were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was
watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it
without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and
her vanity was satisfied with believing
that&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;would have been his only choice, had
fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds
was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now
rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted
perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him
for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be
more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few
struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and
desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him
happy.</p>
<p>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating
the circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear
aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really
experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present
detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my
feelings are not only cordial towards&#160;<em>him</em>; they are
even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her
at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very
good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a
more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly
in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative
insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the
mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something
to live on as well as the plain."</p>
