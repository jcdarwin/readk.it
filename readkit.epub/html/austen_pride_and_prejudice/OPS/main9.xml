<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth passed
the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had
the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a
housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who
waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she
requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to
visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note
was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied
with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached
Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</p>
<p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would
have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that
her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering
immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her
from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her
daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the
apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all
advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughter
all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with
hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she
expected.</p>
<p>"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too
ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We
must trespass a little longer on your kindness."</p>
<p>"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister,
I am sure, will not hear of her removal."</p>
<p>"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold
civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention
while she remains with us."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>
<p>"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I
do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,
and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the
world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without
exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell
my other girls they are nothing to&#160;<em>her</em>. You have a
sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the
gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope,
though you have but a short lease."</p>
<p>"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore
if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off
in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite
fixed here."</p>
<p>"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards
her.</p>
<p>"Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly."</p>
<p>"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
seen through I am afraid is pitiful."</p>
<p>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as
yours."</p>
<p>"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not
run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."</p>
<p>"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that
you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."</p>
<p>"Yes, but intricate characters are
the&#160;<em>most</em>&#160;amusing. They have at least that
advantage."</p>
<p>"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few
subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a
very confined and unvarying society."</p>
<p>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something
new to be observed in them for ever."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of
mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as
much of&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;going on in the country as in
town."</p>
<p>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a
moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had
gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</p>
<p>"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the
country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The
country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"</p>
<p>"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave
it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have
each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."</p>
<p>"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was
nothing at all."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for
her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there
was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as
in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."</p>
<p>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not
meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are
few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty
families."</p>
<p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep
his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her
eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for
the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts,
now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn
since&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;coming away.</p>
<p>"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable
man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of
fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always something to say to
everybody.&#160;<em>That</em>&#160;is my idea of good breeding; and
those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open
their mouths, quite mistake the matter."</p>
<p>"Did Charlotte dine with you?"</p>
<p>"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the
mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that
can do their own work;&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;daughters are brought
up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and
the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a
pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte
so&#160;<em>very</em>&#160;plain—but then she is our particular
friend."</p>
<p>"She seems a very pleasant young woman."</p>
<p>"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas
herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not
like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not
often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do
not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a
man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that
my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came
away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young.
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they
were."</p>
<p>"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There
has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder
who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away
love!"</p>
<p>"I have been used to consider poetry as
the&#160;<em>food</em>&#160;of love," said Darcy.</p>
<p>"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes
what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of
inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it
entirely away."</p>
<p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made
Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a
short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley
for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also
with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and
forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the
occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much
graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards
ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her
daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that
the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his
first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>
<p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine
complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her
mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early
age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural
self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her
uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had
increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address
Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him
of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in
the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack
was delightful to their mother's ear:</p>
<p>"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and
when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the
very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she
is ill."</p>
<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes—it would be much
better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely
Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have
given&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;ball," she added, "I shall insist on
their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be
quite a shame if he does not."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth
returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations'
behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the
latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their
censure of&#160;<em>her</em>, in spite of all Miss Bingley's
witticisms on&#160;<em>fine eyes</em>.</p>
