<p>But, you may say, we asked you to speak about women and
fiction—what, has that got to do with a room of one's own? I will
try to explain. When you asked me to speak about women and fiction
I sat down on the banks of a river and began to wonder what the
words meant. They might mean simply a few remarks about Fanny
Burney; a few more about Jane Austen; a tribute to the Brontës and
a sketch of Haworth Parsonage under snow; some witticisms if
possible about Miss Mitford; a respectful allusion to George Eliot;
a reference to Mrs Gaskell and one would have done. But at second
sight the words seemed not so simple. The title women and fiction
might mean, and you may have meant it to mean, women and what they
are like, or it might mean women and the fiction that they write;
or it might mean women and the fiction that is written about them,
or it might mean that somehow all three are inextricably mixed
together and you want me to consider them in that light. But when I
began to consider the subject in this last way, which seemed the
most interesting, I soon saw that it had one fatal drawback. I
should never be able to come to a conclusion. I should never be
able to fulfil what is, I understand, the first duty of a lecturer
to hand you after an hour's discourse a nugget of pure truth to
wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the
mantelpiece for ever. All I could do was to offer you an opinion
upon one minor point—a woman must have money and a room of her own
if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the
great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of
fiction unsolved. I have shirked the duty of coming to a conclusion
upon these two questions—women and fiction remain, so far as I am
concerned, unsolved problems. But in order to make some amends I am
going to do what I can to show you how I arrived at this opinion
about the room and the money. I am going to develop in your
presence as fully and freely as I can the train of thought which
led me to think this. Perhaps if I lay bare the ideas, the
prejudices, that lie behind this statement you will find that they
have some bearing upon women and some upon fiction. At any rate,
when a subject is highly controversial—and any question about sex
is that—one cannot hope to tell the truth. One can only show how
one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold. One can only give
one's audience the chance of drawing their own conclusions as they
observe the limitations, the prejudices, the idiosyncrasies of the
speaker. Fiction here is likely to contain more truth than fact.
Therefore I propose, making use of all the liberties and licences
of a novelist, to tell you the story of the two days that preceded
my coming here—how, bowed down by the weight of the subject which
you have laid upon my shoulders, I pondered it, and made it work in
and out of my daily life. I need not say that what I am about to
describe has no existence; Oxbridge is an invention; so is Fernham;
'I' is only a convenient term for somebody who has no real being.
Lies will flow from my lips, but there may perhaps be some truth
mixed up with them; it is for you to seek out this truth and to
decide whether any part of it is worth keeping. If not, you will of
course throw the whole of it into the waste-paper basket and forget
all about it.</p>
<p>Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael
or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance)
sitting on the banks of a river a week or two ago in fine October
weather, lost in thought. That collar I have spoken of, women and
fiction, the need of coming to some conclusion on a subject that
raises all sorts of prejudices and passions, bowed my head to the
ground. To the right and left bushes of some sort, golden and
crimson, glowed with the colour, even it seemed burnt with the
heat, of fire. On the further bank the willows wept in perpetual
lamentation, their hair about their shoulders. The river reflected
whatever it chose of sky and bridge and burning tree, and when the
undergraduate had oared his boat through the reflections they
closed again, completely, as if he had never been. There one might
have sat the clock round lost in thought. Thought—to call it by a
prouder name than it deserved—had let its line down into the
stream. It swayed, minute after minute, hither and thither among
the reflections and the weeds, letting the water lift it and sink
it until—you know the little tug—the sudden conglomeration of an
idea at the end of one's line: and then the cautious hauling of it
in, and the careful laying of it out? Alas, laid on the grass how
small, how insignificant this thought of mine looked; the sort of
fish that a good fisherman puts back into the water so that it may
grow fatter and be one day worth cooking and eating. I will not
trouble you with that thought now, though if you look carefully you
may find it for yourselves in the course of what I am going to
say.</p>
<p>But however small it was, it had, nevertheless, the mysterious
property of its kind—put back into the mind, it became at once very
exciting, and important; and as it darted and sank, and flashed
hither and thither, set up such a wash and tumult of ideas that it
was impossible to sit still. It was thus that I found myself
walking with extreme rapidity across a grass plot. Instantly a
man's figure rose to intercept me. Nor did I at first understand
that the gesticulations of a curious-looking object, in a cut-away
coat and evening shirt, were aimed at me. His face expressed horror
and indignation. Instinct rather than reason came to my help, he
was a Beadle; I was a woman. This was the turf; there was the path.
Only the Fellows and Scholars are allowed here; the gravel is the
place for me. Such thoughts were the work of a moment. As I
regained the path the arms of the Beadle sank, his face assumed its
usual repose, and though turf is better walking than gravel, no
very great harm was done. The only charge I could bring against the
Fellows and Scholars of whatever the college might happen to be was
that in protection of their turf, which has been rolled for 300
years in succession they had sent my little fish into hiding.</p>
<p>What idea it had been that had sent me so audaciously
trespassing I could not now remember. The spirit of peace descended
like a cloud from heaven, for if the spirit of peace dwells
anywhere, it is in the courts and quadrangles of Oxbridge on a fine
October morning. Strolling through those colleges past those
ancient halls the roughness of the present seemed smoothed away;
the body seemed contained in a miraculous glass cabinet through
which no sound could penetrate, and the mind, freed from any
contact with facts (unless one trespassed on the turf again), was
at liberty to settle down upon whatever meditation was in harmony
with the moment. As chance would have it, some stray memory of some
old essay about revisiting Oxbridge in the long vacation brought
Charles Lamb to mind—Saint Charles, said Thackeray, putting a
letter of Lamb's to his forehead. Indeed, among all the dead (I
give you my thoughts as they came to me), Lamb is one of the most
congenial; one to whom one would have liked to say, Tell me then
how you wrote your essays? For his essays are superior even to Max
Beerbohm's, I thought, with all their perfection, because of that
wild flash of imagination, that lightning crack of genius in the
middle of them which leaves them flawed and imperfect, but starred
with poetry. Lamb then came to Oxbridge perhaps a hundred years
ago. Certainly he wrote an essay—the name escapes me—about the
manuscript of one of Milton's poems which he saw here. It was
LYCIDAS perhaps, and Lamb wrote how it shocked him to think it
possible that any word in LYCIDAS could have been different from
what it is. To think of Milton changing the words in that poem
seemed to him a sort of sacrilege. This led me to remember what I
could of LYCIDAS and to amuse myself with guessing which word it
could have been that Milton had altered, and why. It then occurred
to me that the very manuscript itself which Lamb had looked at was
only a few hundred yards away, so that one could follow Lamb's
footsteps across the quadrangle to that famous library where the
treasure is kept. Moreover, I recollected, as I put this plan into
execution, it is in this famous library that the manuscript of
Thackeray's ESMOND is also preserved. The critics often say that
ESMOND is Thackeray's most perfect novel. But the affectation of
the style, with its imitation of the eighteenth century, hampers
one, so far as I can remember; unless indeed the eighteenth-century
style was natural to Thackeray—a fact that one might prove by
looking at the manuscript and seeing whether the alterations were
for the benefit of the style or of the sense. But then one would
have to decide what is style and what is meaning, a question
which—but here I was actually at the door which leads into the
library itself. I must have opened it, for instantly there issued,
like a guardian angel barring the way with a flutter of black gown
instead of white wings, a deprecating, silvery, kindly gentleman,
who regretted in a low voice as he waved me back that ladies are
only admitted to the library if accompanied by a Fellow of the
College or furnished with a letter of introduction.</p>
<p>That a famous library has been cursed by a woman is a matter of
complete indifference to a famous library. Venerable and calm, with
all its treasures safe locked within its breast, it sleeps
complacently and will, so far as I am concerned, so sleep for ever.
Never will I wake those echoes, never will I ask for that
hospitality again, I vowed as I descended the steps in anger. Still
an hour remained before luncheon, and what was one to do? Stroll on
the meadows? sit by the river? Certainly it was a lovely autumn
morning; the leaves were fluttering red to the ground; there was no
great hardship in doing either. But the sound of music reached my
ear. Some service or celebration was going forward. The organ
complained magnificently as I passed the chapel door. Even the
sorrow of Christianity sounded in that serene air more like the
recollection of sorrow than sorrow itself; even the groanings of
the ancient organ seemed lapped in peace. I had no wish to enter
had I the right, and this time the verger might have stopped me,
demanding perhaps my baptismal certificate, or a letter of
introduction from the Dean. But the outside of these magnificent
buildings is often as beautiful as the inside. Moreover, it was
amusing enough to watch the congregation assembling, coming in and
going out again, busying themselves at the door of the chapel like
bees at the mouth of a hive. Many were in cap and gown; some had
tufts of fur on their shoulders; others were wheeled in
bath-chairs; others, though not past middle age, seemed creased and
crushed into shapes so singular that one was reminded of those
giant crabs and crayfish who heave with difficulty across the sand
of an aquarium. As I leant against the wall the University indeed
seemed a sanctuary in which are preserved rare types which would
soon be obsolete if left to fight for existence on the pavement of
the Strand. Old stories of old deans and old dons came back to
mind, but before I had summoned up courage to whistle—it used to be
said that at the sound of a whistle old Professor —— instantly
broke into a gallop—the venerable congregation had gone inside. The
outside of the chapel remained. As you know, its high domes and
pinnacles can be seen, like a sailing-ship always voyaging never
arriving, lit up at night and visible for miles, far away across
the hills. Once, presumably, this quadrangle with its smooth lawns,
its massive buildings and the chapel itself was marsh too, where
the grasses waved and the swine rootled. Teams of horses and oxen,
I thought, must have hauled the stone in wagons from far countries,
and then with infinite labour the grey blocks in whose shade I was
now standing were poised in order one on top of another. and then
the painters brought their glass for the windows, and the masons
were busy for centuries up on that roof with putty and cement,
spade and trowel. Every Saturday somebody must have poured gold and
silver out of a leathern purse into their ancient fists, for they
had their beer and skittles presumably of an evening. An unending
stream of gold and silver, I thought, must have flowed into this
court perpetually to keep the stones coming and the masons working;
to level, to ditch, to dig and to drain. But it was then the age of
faith, and money was poured liberally to set these stones on a deep
foundation, and when the stones were raised, still more money was
poured in from the coffers of kings and queens and great nobles to
ensure that hymns should be sung here and scholars taught. Lands
were granted; tithes were paid. And when the age of faith was over
and the age of reason had come, still the same flow of gold and
silver went on; fellowships were founded; lectureships endowed;
only the gold and silver flowed now, not from the coffers of the
king. but from the chests of merchants and manufacturers, from the
purses of men who had made, say, a fortune from industry, and
returned, in their wills, a bounteous share of it to endow more
chairs, more lectureships, more fellowships in the university where
they had learnt their craft. Hence the libraries and laboratories;
the observatories; the splendid equipment of costly and delicate
instruments which now stands on glass shelves, where centuries ago
the grasses waved and the swine rootled. Certainly, as I strolled
round the court, the foundation of gold and silver seemed deep
enough; the pavement laid solidly over the wild grasses. Men with
trays on their heads went busily from staircase to staircase. Gaudy
blossoms flowered in window-boxes. The strains of the gramophone
blared out from the rooms within. It was impossible not to
reflect—the reflection whatever it may have been was cut short. The
clock struck. it was time to find one's way to luncheon.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that novelists have a way of making us
believe that luncheon parties are invariably memorable for
something very witty that was said, or for something very wise that
was done. But they seldom spare a word for what was eaten. It is
part of the novelist's convention not to mention soup and salmon
and ducklings, as if soup and salmon and ducklings were of no
importance whatsoever, as if nobody ever smoked a cigar or drank a
glass of wine. Here, however, I shall take the liberty to defy that
convention and to tell you that the lunch on this occasion began
with soles, sunk in a deep dish, over which the college cook had
spread a counterpane of the whitest cream, save that it was branded
here and there with brown spots like the spots on the flanks of a
doe. After that came the partridges, but if this suggests a couple
of bald, brown birds on a plate you are mistaken. The partridges,
many and various, came with all their retinue of sauces and salads,
the sharp and the sweet, each in its order; their potatoes, thin as
coins but not so hard; their sprouts, foliated as rosebuds but more
succulent. And no sooner had the roast and its retinue been done
with than the silent servingman, the Beadle himself perhaps in a
milder manifestation, set before us, wreathed in napkins, a
confection which rose all sugar from the waves. To call it pudding
and so relate it to rice and tapioca would be an insult. Meanwhile
the wineglasses had flushed yellow and flushed crimson; had been
emptied; had been filled. And thus by degrees was lit, half-way
down the spine, which is the seat of the soul, not that hard little
electric light which we call brilliance, as it pops in and out upon
our lips, but the more profound, subtle and subterranean glow which
is the rich yellow flame of rational intercourse. No need to hurry.
No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself. We are all
going to heaven and Vandyck is of the company—in other words, how
good life seemed, how sweet its rewards, how trivial this grudge or
that grievance, how admirable friendship and the society of one's
kind, as, lighting a good cigarette, one sunk among the cushions in
the window-seat.</p>
<p>If by good luck there had been an ash-tray handy, if one had not
knocked the ash out of the window in default, if things had been a
little different from what they were, one would not have seen,
presumably, a cat without a tail. The sight of that abrupt and
truncated animal padding softly across the quadrangle changed by
some fluke of the subconscious intelligence the emotional light for
me. It was as if someone had let fall a shade. Perhaps the
excellent hock was relinquishing its hold. Certainly, as I watched
the Manx cat pause in the middle of the lawn as if it too
questioned the universe, something seemed lacking, something seemed
different. But what was lacking, what was different, I asked
myself, listening to the talk? And to answer that question I had to
think myself out of the room, back into the past, before the war
indeed, and to set before my eyes the model of another luncheon
party held in rooms not very far distant from these; but different.
Everything was different. Meanwhile the talk went on among the
guests, who were many and young, some of this sex, some of that; it
went on swimmingly, it went on agreeably, freely, amusingly. And as
it went on I set it against the background of that other talk, and
as I matched the two together I had no doubt that one was the
descendant, the legitimate heir of the other. Nothing was changed;
nothing was different save only here I listened with all my ears
not entirely to what was being said, but to the murmur or current
behind it. Yes, that was it—the change was there. Before the war at
a luncheon party like this people would have said precisely the
same things but they would have sounded different, because in those
days they were accompanied by a sort of humming noise, not
articulate, but musical, exciting, which changed the value of the
words themselves. Could one set that humming noise to words?
Perhaps with the help of the poets one could.. A book lay beside me
and, opening it, I turned casually enough to Tennyson. And here I
found Tennyson was singing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has fallen a splendid tear<br />
From the passion-flower at the gate.<br />
She is coming, my dove, my dear;<br />
She is coming, my life, my fate;<br />
The red rose cries, 'She is near, she is near';<br />
And the white rose weeps, 'She is late';<br />
The larkspur listens, 'I hear, I hear';<br />
And the lily whispers, 'I wait.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was that what men hummed at luncheon parties before the war? And
the women?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My heart is like a singing bird<br />
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;<br />
My heart is like an apple tree<br />
Whose boughs are bent with thick-set fruit,<br />
My heart is like a rainbow shell<br />
That paddles in a halcyon sea;<br />
My heart is gladder than all these<br />
Because my love is come to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was that what women hummed at luncheon parties before the
war?</p>
<p>There was something so ludicrous in thinking of people humming
such things even under their breath at luncheon parties before the
war that I burst out laughing. and had to explain my laughter by
pointing at the Manx cat, who did look a little absurd, poor beast,
without a tail, in the middle of the lawn. Was he really born so,
or had he lost his tail in an accident? The tailless cat, though
some are said to exist in the Isle of Man, is rarer than one
thinks. It is a queer animal, quaint rather than beautiful. It is
strange what a difference a tail makes—you know the sort of things
one says as a lunch party breaks up and people are finding their
coats and hats.</p>
<p>This one, thanks to the hospitality of the host, had lasted far
into the afternoon. The beautiful October day was fading and the
leaves were falling from the trees in the avenue as I walked
through it. Gate after gate seemed to close with gentle finality
behind me. Innumerable beadles were fitting innumerable keys into
well-oiled locks; the treasure-house was being made secure for
another night. After the avenue one comes out upon a road—I forget
its name—which leads you, if you take the right turning, along to
Fernham. But there was plenty of time. Dinner was not till
half-past seven. One could almost do without dinner after such a
luncheon. It is strange how a scrap of poetry works in the mind and
makes the legs move in time to it along the road. Those words——</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has fallen a splendid tear<br />
From the passion-flower at the gate.<br />
She is coming, my dove, my dear——</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sang in my blood as I stepped quickly along towards Headingley.
And then, switching off into the other measure, I sang, where the
waters are churned up by the weir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My heart is like a singing bird<br />
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;<br />
My heart is like an apple tree…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What poets, I cried aloud, as one does in the dusk, what poets
they were!</p>
<p>In a sort of jealousy, I suppose, for our own age, silly and
absurd though these comparisons are, I went on to wonder if
honestly one could name two living poets now as great as Tennyson
and Christina Rossetti were then. Obviously it is impossible, I
thought, looking into those foaming waters, to compare them. The
very reason why that poetry excites one to such abandonment, such
rapture, is that it celebrates some feeling that one used to have
(at luncheon parties before the war perhaps), so that one responds
easily, familiarly, without troubling to check the feeling, or to
compare it with any that one has now. But the living poets express
a feeling that is actually being made and torn out of us at the
moment. One does not recognize it in the first place; often for
some reason one fears it; one watches it with keenness and compares
it jealously and suspiciously with the old feeling that one knew.
Hence the difficulty of modern poetry; and it is because of this
difficulty that one cannot remember more than two consecutive lines
of any good modern poet. For this reason—that my memory failed
me—the argument flagged for want of material. But why, I continued,
moving on towards Headingley, have we stopped humming under our
breath at luncheon parties? Why has Alfred ceased to sing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She is coming, my dove, my dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why has Christina ceased to respond</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My heart is gladder than all these<br />
Because my love is come to me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shall we lay the blame on the war? When the guns fired in August
1914, did the faces of men and women show so plain in each other's
eyes that romance was killed? Certainly it was a shock (to women in
particular with their illusions about education, and so on) to see
the faces of our rulers in the light of the shell-fire. So ugly
they looked—German, English, French—so stupid. But lay the blame
where one will, on whom one will, the illusion which inspired
Tennyson and Christina Rossetti to sing so passionately about the
coming of their loves is far rarer now than then. One has only to
read, to look, to listen, to remember. But why say 'blame'? Why, if
it was an illusion, not praise the catastrophe, whatever it was,
that destroyed illusion and put truth in its place? For truth…
those dots mark the spot where, in search of truth, I missed the
turning up to Fernham. Yes indeed, which was truth and which was
illusion? I asked myself. What was the truth about these houses,
for example, dim and festive now with their red windows in the
dusk, but raw and red and squalid, with their sweets and their
bootlaces, at nine o'clock in the morning? And the willows and the
river and the gardens that run down to the river, vague now with
the mist stealing over them, but gold and red in the sunlight—which
was the truth, which was the illusion about them? I spare you the
twists and turns of my cogitations, for no conclusion was found on
the road to Headingley, and I ask You to suppose that I soon found
out my mistake about the turning and retraced my steps to
Fernham.</p>
<p>As I have said already that it was an October day, I dare not
forfeit your respect and imperil the fair name of fiction by
changing the season and describing lilacs hanging over garden
walls, crocuses, tulips and other flowers of spring. Fiction must
stick to facts, and the truer the facts the better the fiction—so
we are told. Therefore it was still autumn and the leaves were
still yellow and falling, if anything, a little faster than before,
because it was now evening (seven twenty-three to be precise) and a
breeze (from the south-west to be exact) had risen. But for all
that there was something odd at work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My heart is like a singing bird<br />
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;<br />
My heart is like an apple tree<br />
Whose boughs are bent with thick-set fruit—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>perhaps the words of Christina Rossetti were partly responsible
for the folly of the fancy—it was nothing of course but a
fancy—that the lilac was shaking its flowers over the garden walls,
and the brimstone butterflies were scudding hither and thither, and
the dust of the pollen was in the air. A wind blew, from what
quarter I know not, but it lifted the half-grown leaves so that
there was a flash of silver grey in the air. It was the time
between the lights when colours undergo their intensification and
purples and golds burn in window-panes like the beat of an
excitable heart; when for some reason the beauty of the world
revealed and yet soon to perish (here I pushed into the garden,
for, unwisely, the door was left open and no beadles seemed about),
the beauty of the world which is so soon to perish, has two edges,
one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder. The
gardens of Fernham lay before me in the spring twilight, wild and
open, and in the long grass, sprinkled and carelessly flung, were
daffodils and bluebells, not orderly perhaps at the best of times,
and now wind-blown and waving as they tugged at their roots. The
windows of the building, curved like ships' windows among generous
waves of red brick, changed from lemon to silver under the flight
of the quick spring clouds. Somebody was in a hammock, somebody,
but in this light they were phantoms only, half guessed, half seen,
raced across the grass—would no one stop her?—and then on the
terrace, as if popping out to breathe the air, to glance at the
garden, came a bent figure, formidable yet humble, with her great
forehead and her shabby dress—could it be the famous scholar, could
it be J—— H—— herself? All was dim, yet intense too, as if the
scarf which the dusk had flung over the garden were torn asunder by
star or sword—the gash of some terrible reality leaping, as its way
is, out of the heart of the spring. For youth——</p>
<p>Here was my soup. Dinner was being served in the great
dining-hall. Far from being spring it was in fact an evening in
October. Everybody was assembled in the big dining-room. Dinner was
ready. Here was the soup. It was a plain gravy soup. There was
nothing to stir the fancy in that. One could have seen through the
transparent liquid any pattern that there might have been on the
plate itself. But there was no pattern. The plate was plain. Next
came beef with its attendant greens and potatoes—a homely trinity,
suggesting the rumps of cattle in a muddy market, and sprouts
curled and yellowed at the edge, and bargaining and cheapening and
women with string bags on Monday morning. There was no reason to
complain of human nature's daily food, seeing that the supply was
sufficient and coal-miners doubtless were sitting down to less.
Prunes and custard followed. And if anyone complains that prunes,
even when mitigated by custard, are an uncharitable vegetable
(fruit they are not), stringy as a miser's heart and exuding a
fluid such as might run in misers' veins who have denied themselves
wine and warmth for eighty years and yet not given to the poor, he
should reflect that there are people whose charity embraces even
the prune. Biscuits and cheese came next, and here the water-jug
was liberally passed round, for it is the nature of biscuits to be
dry, and these were biscuits to the core. That was all. The meal
was over. Everybody scraped their chairs back; the swing-doors
swung violently to and fro; soon the hall was emptied of every sign
of food and made ready no doubt for breakfast next morning. Down
corridors and up staircases the youth of England went banging and
singing. And was it for a guest, a stranger (for I had no more
right here in Fernham than in Trinity or Somerville or Girton or
Newnham or Christchurch), to say, 'The dinner was not good,' or to
say (we were now, Mary Seton and I, in her sitting-room), 'Could we
not have dined up here alone?' for if I had said anything of the
kind I should have been prying and searching into the secret
economies of a house which to the stranger wears so fine a front of
gaiety and courage. No, one could say nothing of the sort. Indeed,
conversation for a moment flagged. The human frame being what it
is, heart, body and brain all mixed together, and not contained in
separate compartments as they will be no doubt in another million
years, a good dinner is of great importance to good talk. One
cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined
well. The lamp in the spine does not light on beef and prunes. We
are all PROBABLY going to heaven, and Vandyck is, we HOPE, to meet
us round the next corner—that is the dubious and qualifying state
of mind that beef and prunes at the end of the day's work breed
between them. Happily my friend, who taught science, had a cupboard
where there was a squat bottle and little glasses—(but there should
have been sole and partridge to begin with)—so that we were able to
draw up to the fire and repair some of the damages of the day's
living. In a minute or so we were slipping freely in and out among
all those objects of curiosity and interest which form in the mind
in the absence of a particular person, and are naturally to be
discussed on coming together again—how somebody has married,
another has not; one thinks this, another that; one has improved
out of all knowledge, the other most amazingly gone to the bad—with
all those speculations upon human nature and the character of the
amazing world we live in which spring naturally from such
beginnings. While these things were being said, however, I became
shamefacedly aware of a current setting in of its own accord and
carrying everything forward to an end of its own. One might be
talking of Spain or Portugal, of book or racehorse, but the real
interest of whatever was said was none of those things, but a scene
of masons on a high roof some five centuries ago. Kings and nobles
brought treasure in huge sacks and poured it under the earth. This
scene was for ever coming alive in my mind and placing itself by
another of lean cows and a muddy market and withered greens and the
stringy hearts of old men—these two pictures, disjointed and
disconnected and nonsensical as they were, were for ever coming
together and combating each other and had me entirely at their
mercy. The best course, unless the whole talk was to be distorted,
was to expose what was in my mind to the air, when with good luck
it would fade and crumble like the head of the dead king when they
opened the coffin at Windsor. Briefly, then, I told Miss Seton
about the masons who had been all those years on the roof of the
chapel, and about the kings and queens and nobles bearing sacks of
gold and silver on their shoulders, which they shovelled into the
earth; and then how the great financial magnates of our own time
came and laid cheques and bonds, I suppose, where the others had
laid ingots and rough lumps of gold. All that lies beneath the
colleges down there, I said; but this college, where we are now
sitting, what lies beneath its gallant red brick and the wild
unkempt grasses of the garden? What force is behind that plain
china off which we dined, and (here it popped out of my mouth
before I could stop it) the beef, the custard and the prunes?</p>
<p>Well, said Mary Seton, about the year 1860—Oh, but you know the
story, she said, bored, I suppose, by the recital. And she told
me—rooms were hired. Committees met. Envelopes were addressed.
Circulars were drawn up. Meetings were held; letters were read out;
so-and-so has promised so much; on the contrary, Mr —— won't give a
penny. The SATURDAY REVIEW has been very rude. How can we raise a
fund to pay for offices? Shall we hold a bazaar? Can't we find a
pretty girl to sit in the front row? Let us look up what John
Stuart Mill said on the subject. Can anyone persuade the editor of
the —— to print a letter? Can we get Lady —— to sign it? Lady —— is
out of town. That was the way it was done, presumably, sixty years
ago, and it was a prodigious effort, and a great deal of time was
spent on it. And it was only after a long struggle and with the
utmost difficulty that they got thirty thousand pounds
together<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_1" id=

<p>At the thought of all those women working year after year and
finding it hard to get two thousand pounds together, and as much as
they could do to get thirty thousand pounds, we burst out in scorn
at the reprehensible poverty of our sex. What had our mothers been
doing then that they had no wealth to leave us? Powdering their
noses? Looking in at shop windows? Flaunting in the sun at Monte
Carlo? There were some photographs on the mantelpiece. Mary's
mother—if that was her picture—may have been a wastrel in her spare
time (she had thirteen children by a minister of the church), but
if so her gay and dissipated life had left too few traces of its
pleasures on her face. She was a homely body; an old lady in a
plaid shawl which was fastened by a large cameo; and she sat in a
basket-chair, encouraging a spaniel to look at the camera, with the
amused, yet strained expression of one who is sure that the dog
will move directly the bulb is pressed. Now if she had gone into
business; had become a manufacturer of artificial silk or a magnate
on the Stock Exchange; if she had left two or three hundred
thousand pounds to Fernham, we could have been sitting at our ease
to-night and the subject of our talk might have been archaeology,
botany, anthropology, physics, the nature of the atom, mathematics,
astronomy, relativity, geography. If only Mrs Seton and her mother
and her mother before her had learnt the great art of making money
and had left their money, like their fathers and their grandfathers
before them, to found fellowships and lectureships and prizes and
scholarships appropriated to the use of their own sex, we might
have dined very tolerably up here alone off a bird and a bottle of
wine; we might have looked forward without undue confidence to a
pleasant and honourable lifetime spent in the shelter of one of the
liberally endowed professions. We might have been exploring or
writing; mooning about the venerable places of the earth; sitting
contemplative on the steps of the Parthenon, or going at ten to an
office and coming home comfortably at half-past four to write a
little poetry. Only, if Mrs Seton and her like had gone into
business at the age of fifteen, there would have been—that was the
snag in the argument—no Mary. What, I asked, did Mary think of
that? There between the curtains was the October night, calm and
lovely, with a star or two caught in the yellowing trees. Was she
ready to resign her share of it and her memories (for they had been
a happy family, though a large one) of games and quarrels up in
Scotland, which she is never tired of praising for the fineness of
its air and the quality of its cakes, in order that Fernham might
have been endowed with fifty thousand pounds or so by a stroke of
the pen? For, to endow a college would necessitate the suppression
of families altogether. Making a fortune and bearing thirteen
children—no human being could stand it. Consider the facts, we
said. First there are nine months before the baby is born. Then the
baby is born. Then there are three or four months spent in feeding
the baby. After the baby is fed there are certainly five years
spent in playing with the baby. You cannot, it seems, let children
run about the streets. People who have seen them running wild in
Russia say that the sight is not a pleasant one. People say, too,
that human nature takes its shape in the years between one and
five. If Mrs Seton, I said, had been making money, what sort of
memories would you have had of games and quarrels? What would you
have known of Scotland, and its fine air and cakes and all the rest
of it? But it is useless to ask these questions, because you would
never have come into existence at all. Moreover, it is equally
useless to ask what might have happened if Mrs Seton and her mother
and her mother before her had amassed great wealth and laid it
under the foundations of college and library, because, in the first
place, to earn money was impossible for them, and in the second,
had it been possible, the law denied them the right to possess what
money they earned. It is only for the last forty-eight years that
Mrs Seton has had a penny of her own. For all the centuries before
that it would have been her husband's property—a thought which,
perhaps, may have had its share in keeping Mrs Seton and her
mothers off the Stock Exchange. Every penny I earn, they may have
said, will be taken from me and disposed of according to my
husband's wisdom—perhaps to found a scholarship or to endow a
fellowship in Balliol or Kings, so that to earn money, even if I
could earn money, is not a matter that interests me very greatly. I
had better leave it to my husband.</p>
<p>At any rate, whether or not the blame rested on the old lady who
was looking at the spaniel, there could be no doubt that for some
reason or other our mothers had mismanaged their affairs very
gravely. Not a penny could be spared for 'amenities'; for
partridges and wine, beadles and turf, books and cigars, libraries
and leisure. To raise bare walls out of bare earth was the utmost
they could do.</p>
<p>So we talked standing at the window and looking, as so many
thousands look every night, down on the domes and towers of the
famous city beneath us. It was very beautiful, very mysterious in
the autumn moonlight. The old stone looked very white and
venerable. One thought of all the books that were assembled down
there; of the pictures of old prelates and worthies hanging in the
panelled rooms; of the painted windows that would be throwing
strange globes and crescents on the pavement; of the tablets and
memorials and inscriptions; of the fountains and the grass; of the
quiet rooms looking across the quiet quadrangles. And (pardon me
the thought) I thought, too, of the admirable smoke and drink and
the deep armchairs and the pleasant carpets: of the urbanity, the
geniality, the dignity which are the offspring of luxury and
privacy and space. Certainly our mothers had not provided us with
any thing comparable to all this—our mothers who found it difficult
to scrape together thirty thousand pounds, our mothers who bore
thirteen children to ministers of religion at St Andrews.</p>
<p>So I went back to my inn, and as I walked through the dark
streets I pondered this and that, as one does at the end of the
day's work. I pondered why it was that Mrs Seton had no money to
leave us; and what effect poverty has on the mind; and what effect
wealth has on the mind; and I thought of the queer old gentlemen I
had seen that morning with tufts of fur upon their shoulders; and I
remembered how if one whistled one of them ran; and I thought of
the organ booming in the chapel and of the shut doors of the
library; and I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out; and I
thought how it is worse perhaps to be locked in; and, thinking of
the safety and prosperity of the one sex and of the poverty and
insecurity of the other and of the effect of tradition and of the
lack of tradition upon the mind of a writer, I thought at last that
it was time to roll up the crumpled skin of the day, with its
arguments and its impressions and its anger and its laughter, and
cast it into the hedge. A thousand stars were flashing across the
blue wastes of the sky. One seemed alone with an inscrutable
society. All human beings were laid asleep—prone, horizontal, dumb.
Nobody seemed stirring in the streets of Oxbridge. Even the door of
the hotel sprang open at the touch of an invisible hand—not a boots
was sitting up to light me to bed, it was so late.</p>
