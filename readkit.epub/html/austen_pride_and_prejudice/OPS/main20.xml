<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Collins was
not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love;
for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for
the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door
and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself
in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr.
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal
pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their
interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason
to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly
given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the
genuine delicacy of her character.</p>
<p>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have
been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to
encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared
not believe it, and could not help saying so.</p>
<p>"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall
be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is
a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest
but I will&#160;<em>make</em>&#160;her know it."</p>
<p>"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but
if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she
would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation,
who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If
therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it
were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable
to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my
felicity."</p>
<p>"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything
else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go
directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her,
I am sure."</p>
<p>She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to
her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr.
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You
must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind
and not have&#160;<em>her</em>."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and
fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the
least altered by her communication.</p>
<p>"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when
she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"</p>
<p>"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.
Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have
Lizzy."</p>
<p>"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless
business."</p>
<p>"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon
her marrying him."</p>
<p>"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to
the library.</p>
<p>"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have
sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.
Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth
replied that it was. "Very well—and this offer of marriage you have
refused?"</p>
<p>"I have, sir."</p>
<p>"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon
your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"</p>
<p>"Yes, or I will never see her again."</p>
<p>"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day
you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will
never see you again if you do&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;marry Mr.
Collins, and I will never see you again if
you&#160;<em>do</em>."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a
beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her
husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively
disappointed.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised
me to&#160;<em>insist</em>&#160;upon her marrying him."</p>
<p>"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to
request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my
understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I
shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."</p>
<p>Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,
did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again
and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to
secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness,
declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real
earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her
attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never
did.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had
passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what
motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt,
he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite
imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's
reproach prevented his feeling any regret.</p>
<p>While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to
spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,
who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are
come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened
this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will
not have him."</p>
<p>Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by
Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they
entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she
likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her
compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to
comply with the wishes of all her family. "Pray do, my dear Miss
Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side,
nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my
poor nerves."</p>
<p>Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as
unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at
York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss
Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer
of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I
am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is
dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I have
done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you
know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me
as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful
children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to
anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer!
But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never
pitied."</p>
<p>Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible
that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only
increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without
interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr.
Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual,
and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I do insist
upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and
Mr. Collins have a little conversation together."</p>
<p>Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty
followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she
could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.
Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very
minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with
walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful
voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh! Mr.
Collins!"</p>
<p>"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this
point. Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that
marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.
Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the
peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have
been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not
the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my
fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed
that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied
begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will
not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family,
my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted
my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we
are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the
whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for
myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your
family, and if my&#160;<em>manner</em>&#160;has been at all
reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."</p>
