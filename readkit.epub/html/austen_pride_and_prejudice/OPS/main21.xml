<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he discussion of
Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had
only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman
himself,&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;feelings were chiefly expressed,
not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but
by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever
spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so
sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to
Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable
relief to them all, and especially to her friend.</p>
<p>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or
ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit,
but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was
always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to
stay.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr.
Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the
Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and
attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and
the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,
however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his
absence<em>had</em>&#160;been self-imposed.</p>
<p>"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not
meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with
him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,
and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."</p>
<p>She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a
full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they
civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he
particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double
advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and
it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her
father and mother.</p>
<p>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;
it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of
elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance
change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some
particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the
letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the
general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject
which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had
he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited
her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:</p>
<p>"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised
me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,
and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming
back again. You shall hear what she says."</p>
<p>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the
information of their having just resolved to follow their brother
to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street,
where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: "I do not
pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except
your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future
period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we
have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation
by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on
you for that." To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened
with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness
of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to
lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from
Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the
loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.</p>
<p>"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should
not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But
may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss
Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and
that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be
renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will
not be detained in London by them."</p>
<p>"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"</p>
<p>"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the
business which took him to London might be concluded in three or
four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same
time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no
hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him
thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a
comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for
the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,
had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair.
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the
gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you."</p>
<p>"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more
this winter."</p>
<p>"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that
he&#160;<em>should</em>."</p>
<p>"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know&#160;<em>all</em>.
I&#160;<em>will</em>&#160;read you the passage which particularly
hurts me. I will have no reserves from&#160;<em>you</em>."</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the
truth,&#160;<em>we</em>&#160;are scarcely less eager to meet her
again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for
beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she
inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still
more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being
hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned
to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem
them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will
have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate
footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own;
and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I
call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all
these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent
it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event
which will secure the happiness of so many?"</p>
<p>"What do you think of&#160;<em>this</em>&#160;sentence, my dear
Lizzy?" said Jane as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does
it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes
me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her
brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my
feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear
it?"</p>
<p>"Most willingly."</p>
<p>"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her
brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She
follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to
persuade you that he does not care about you."</p>
<p>Jane shook her head.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen
you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,
cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as
much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her
wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or
grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss
Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has
been&#160;<em>one</em>&#160;intermarriage, she may have less
trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some
ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were
out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine
that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires
Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible
of&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that,
instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her
friend."</p>
<p>"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is
deceiving herself."</p>
<p>"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,
since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be
deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and
must fret no longer."</p>
<p>"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best,
in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to
marry elsewhere?"</p>
<p>"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon
mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his
two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his
wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."</p>
<p>"How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must
know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their
disapprobation, I could not hesitate."</p>
<p>"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot
consider your situation with much compassion."</p>
<p>"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"</p>
<p>The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the
utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of
Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment
suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could
influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.</p>
<p>She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she
felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy
effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led
to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the
hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every
wish of her heart.</p>
<p>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure
of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the
gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a
great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky
that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all
getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some
length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down
again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was
the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only
to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full
courses.</p>
