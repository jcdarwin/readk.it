<div class="text">
<p>One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams,
he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous
vermin. He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his
head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid
bow-like sections. From this height the blanket, just about ready
to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous
legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his
circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.</p>
<p>"What's happened to me?" he thought. It was no dream. His room,
a proper room for a human being, only somewhat too small, lay
quietly between the four well-known walls. Above the table, on
which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread
out—Samsa was a travelling salesman—hung the picture which he had
cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and set in a
pretty gilt frame. It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a
fur boa. She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the
viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm had
disappeared.</p>
<p>Gregor's glance then turned to the window. The dreary
weather—the rain drops were falling audibly down on the metal
window ledge—made him quite melancholy. "Why don't I keep sleeping
for a little while longer and forget all this foolishness," he
thought. But this was entirely impractical, for he was used to
sleeping on his right side, and in his present state he couldn't
get himself into this position. No matter how hard he threw himself
onto his right side, he always rolled again onto his back. He must
have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so that he would
not have to see the wriggling legs, and gave up only when he began
to feel a light, dull pain in his side which he had never felt
before.</p>
<p>"O God," he thought, "what a demanding job I've chosen! Day in,
day out, on the road. The stresses of selling are much greater than
the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have
to cope with the problems of travelling, the worries about train
connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing
human relationships which never come from the heart. To hell with
it all!" He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen. He
slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so that he
could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was
entirely covered with small white spots—he did not know what to
make of them and wanted to feel the place with a leg. But he
retracted it immediately, for the contact felt like a cold shower
all over him.</p>
<p>He slid back again into his earlier position. "This getting up
early," he thought, "makes a man quite idiotic. A man must have his
sleep. Other travelling salesmen live like harem women. For
instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the
morning to write up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just
sitting down to breakfast. If I were to try that with my boss, I'd
be thrown out on the spot. Still, who knows whether that mightn't
be really good for me? If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake,
I'd have quit ages ago. I would've gone to the boss and told him
just what I think from the bottom of my heart. He would've fallen
right off his desk! How weird it is to sit up at that desk and talk
down to the employee from way up there. The boss has trouble
hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him. Anyway,
I haven't completely given up that hope yet. Once I've got together
the money to pay off my parents' debt to him—that should take
another five or six years—I'll do it for sure. Then I'll make the
big break. In any case, right now I have to get up. My train leaves
at five o'clock."</p>
<p>He looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of
drawers. "Good God!" he thought. It was half past six, and the
hands were going quietly on. It was past the half hour, already
nearly quarter to. Could the alarm have failed to ring? One saw
from the bed that it was properly set for four o'clock. Certainly
it had rung. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through that noise
which made the furniture shake? Now, it's true he'd not slept
quietly, but evidently he'd slept all the more deeply. Still, what
should he do now? The next train left at seven o'clock. To catch
that one, he would have to go in a mad rush. The sample collection
wasn't packed up yet, and he really didn't feel particularly fresh
and active. And even if he caught the train, there was no avoiding
a blow-up with the boss, because the firm's errand boy would've
waited for the five o'clock train and reported the news of his
absence long ago. He was the boss's minion, without backbone or
intelligence. Well then, what if he reported in sick? But that
would be extremely embarrassing and suspicious, because during his
five years' service Gregor hadn't been sick even once. The boss
would certainly come with the doctor from the health insurance
company and would reproach his parents for their lazy son and cut
short all objections with the insurance doctor's comments; for him
everyone was completely healthy but really lazy about work. And
besides, would the doctor in this case be totally wrong? Apart from
a really excessive drowsiness after the long sleep, Gregor in fact
felt quite well and even had a really strong appetite.</p>
<p>As he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, without
being able to make the decision to get out of bed—the alarm clock
was indicating exactly quarter to seven—there was a cautious knock
on the door by the head of the bed.</p>
<p>"Gregor," a voice called—it was his mother!—"it's quarter to
seven. Don't you want to be on your way?" The soft voice! Gregor
was startled when he heard his voice answering. It was clearly and
unmistakably his earlier voice, but in it was intermingled, as if
from below, an irrepressibly painful squeaking, which left the
words positively distinct only in the first moment and distorted
them in the reverberation, so that one didn't know if one had heard
correctly. Gregor wanted to answer in detail and explain
everything, but in these circumstances he confined himself to
saying, "Yes, yes, thank you mother. I'm getting up right away."
Because of the wooden door the change in Gregor's voice was not
really noticeable outside, so his mother calmed down with this
explanation and shuffled off. However, as a result of the short
conversation, the other family members became aware that Gregor was
unexpectedly still at home, and already his father was knocking on
one side door, weakly but with his fist. "Gregor, Gregor," he
called out, "what's going on?" And, after a short while, he urged
him on again in a deeper voice: "Gregor!" Gregor!" At the other
side door, however, his sister knocked lightly. "Gregor? Are you
all right? Do you need anything?" Gregor directed answers in both
directions, "I'll be ready right away." He made an effort with the
most careful articulation and by inserting long pauses between the
individual words to remove everything remarkable from his voice.
His father turned back to his breakfast. However, the sister
whispered, "Gregor, open the door—I beg you." Gregor had no
intention of opening the door, but congratulated himself on his
precaution, acquired from travelling, of locking all doors during
the night, even at home.</p>
<p>First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get
dressed, above all have breakfast, and only then consider further
action, for—he noticed this clearly—by thinking things over in bed
he would not reach a reasonable conclusion. He remembered that he
had already often felt a light pain or other in bed, perhaps the
result of an awkward lying position, which later turned out to be
purely imaginary when he stood up, and he was eager to see how his
present fantasies would gradually dissipate. That the change in his
voice was nothing other than the onset of a real chill, an
occupational illness of commercial travellers, of that he had not
the slightest doubt.</p>
<p>It was very easy to throw aside the blanket. He needed only to
push himself up a little, and it fell by itself. But to continue
was difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide. He
needed arms and hands to push himself upright. Instead of these,
however, he had only many small limbs which were incessantly moving
with very different motions and which, in addition, he was unable
to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then it was the first
to extend itself, and if he finally succeeded doing what he wanted
with this limb, in the meantime all the others, as if left free,
moved around in an excessively painful agitation. "But I must not
stay in bed uselessly," said Gregor to himself.</p>
<p>At first he wanted to get out of bed with the lower part of his
body, but this lower part—which, by the way, he had not yet looked
at and which he also couldn't picture clearly—proved itself too
difficult to move. The attempt went so slowly. When, having become
almost frantic, he finally hurled himself forward with all his
force and without thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and
he hit the lower bedpost hard. The violent pain he felt revealed to
him that the lower part of his body was at the moment probably the
most sensitive.</p>
<p>Thus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first and
turned his head carefully toward the edge of the bed. He managed to
do this easily, and in spite of its width and weight his body mass
at last slowly followed the turning of his head. But as he finally
raised his head outside the bed in the open air, he became anxious
about moving forward any further in this manner, for if he allowed
himself eventually to fall by this process, it would take a miracle
to prevent his head from getting injured. And at all costs he must
not lose consciousness right now. He preferred to remain in
bed.</p>
<p>However, after a similar effort, while he lay there again,
sighing as before, and once again saw his small limbs fighting one
another, if anything worse than earlier, and didn't see any chance
of imposing quiet and order on this arbitrary movement, he told
himself again that he couldn't possibly remain in bed and that it
might be the most reasonable thing to sacrifice everything if there
was even the slightest hope of getting himself out of bed in the
process. At the same moment, however, he didn't forget to remind
himself from time to time of the fact that calm—indeed the
calmest—reflection might be better than the most confused
decisions. At such moments, he directed his gaze as precisely as he
could toward the window, but unfortunately there was little
confident cheer to be had from a glance at the morning mist, which
concealed even the other side of the narrow street. "It's already
seven o'clock," he told himself at the latest striking of the alarm
clock, "already seven o'clock and still such a fog." And for a
little while longer he lay quietly with weak breathing, as if
perhaps waiting for normal and natural conditions to re-emerge out
of the complete stillness.</p>
<p>But then he said to himself, "Before it strikes a quarter past
seven, whatever happens I must be completely out of bed. Besides,
by then someone from the office will arrive to inquire about me,
because the office will open before seven o'clock." And he made an
effort then to rock his entire body length out of the bed with a
uniform motion. If he let himself fall out of the bed in this way,
his head, which in the course of the fall he intended to lift up
sharply, would probably remain uninjured. His back seemed to be
hard; nothing would really happen to that as a result of the fall.
His greatest reservation was a worry about the loud noise which the
fall must create and which presumably would arouse, if not fright,
then at least concern on the other side of all the doors. However,
it had to be tried.</p>
<p>As Gregor was in the process of lifting himself half out of
bed—the new method was more of a game than an effort; he needed
only to rock with a constant rhythm—it struck him how easy all this
would be if someone were to come to his aid. Two strong people—he
thought of his father and the servant girl—would have been quite
sufficient. They would have only had to push their arms under his
arched back to get him out of the bed, to bend down with their
load, and then merely to exercise patience and care that he
completed the flip onto the floor, where his diminutive legs would
then, he hoped, acquire a purpose. Now, quite apart from the fact
that the doors were locked, should he really call out for help? In
spite of all his distress, he was unable to suppress a smile at
this idea.</p>
<p>He had already got to the point where, by rocking more strongly,
he maintained his equilibrium with difficulty, and very soon he
would finally have to decide, for in five minutes it would be a
quarter past seven. Then there was a ring at the door of the
apartment. "That's someone from the office," he told himself, and
he almost froze while his small limbs only danced around all the
faster. For one moment everything remained still. "They aren't
opening," Gregor said to himself, caught up in some absurd hope.
But of course then, as usual, the servant girl with her firm tread
went to the door and opened it. Gregor needed to hear only the
first word of the visitor's greeting to recognize immediately who
it was, the manager himself. Why was Gregor the only one condemned
to work in a firm where, at the slightest lapse, someone
immediately attracted the greatest suspicion? Were all the
employees then collectively, one and all, scoundrels? Among them
was there then no truly devoted person who, if he failed to use
just a couple of hours in the morning for office work, would become
abnormal from pangs of conscience and really be in no state to get
out of bed? Was it really not enough to let an apprentice make
inquiries, if such questioning was even necessary? Must the manager
himself come, and in the process must it be demonstrated to the
entire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious
circumstance could be entrusted only to the intelligence of the
manager? And more as a consequence of the excited state in which
this idea put Gregor than as a result of an actual decision, he
swung himself with all his might out of the bed. There was a loud
thud, but not a real crash. The fall was absorbed somewhat by the
carpet and, in addition, his back was more elastic than Gregor had
thought. For that reason the dull noise was not quite so
conspicuous. But he had not held his head up with sufficient care
and had hit it. He turned his head, irritated and in pain, and
rubbed it on the carpet.</p>
<p>"Something has fallen in there," said the manager in the next
room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine to himself whether
anything similar to what was happening to him today could have also
happened at some point to the manager. At least one had to concede
the possibility of such a thing. However, as if to give a rough
answer to this question, the manager now, with a squeak of his
polished boots, took a few determined steps in the next room. From
the neighbouring room on the right the sister was whispering to
inform Gregor: "Gregor, the manager is here." "I know," said Gregor
to himself. But he did not dare make his voice loud enough so that
his sister could hear.</p>
<p>"Gregor," his father now said from the neighbouring room on the
left, "Mr. Manager has come and is asking why you have not left on
the early train. We don't know what we should tell him. Besides, he
also wants to speak to you personally. So please open the door. He
will be good enough to forgive the mess in your room."</p>
<p>In the middle of all this, the manager called out in a friendly
way, "Good morning, Mr. Samsa." "He is not well," said his mother
to the manager, while his father was still talking at the door, "He
is not well, believe me, Mr. Manager. Otherwise how would Gregor
miss a train? The young man has nothing in his head except
business. I'm almost angry that he never goes out at night. Right
now he's been in the city eight days, but he's been at home every
evening. He sits here with us at the table and reads the newspaper
quietly or studies his travel schedules. It's a quite a diversion
for him to busy himself with fretwork. For instance, he cut out a
small frame over the course of two or three evenings. You'd be
amazed how pretty it is. It's hanging right inside the room. You'll
see it immediately, as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I'm
happy that you're here, Mr. Manager. By ourselves, we would never
have made Gregor open the door. He's so stubborn, and he's
certainly not well, although he denied that this morning."</p>
<p>"I'm coming right away," said Gregor slowly and deliberately and
didn't move, so as not to lose one word of the conversation. "My
dear lady, I cannot explain it to myself in any other way," said
the manager; "I hope it is nothing serious. On the other hand, I
must also say that we business people, luckily or unluckily,
however one looks at it, very often simply have to overcome a
slight indisposition for business reasons." "So can Mr. Manager
come in to see you now?" asked his father impatiently and knocked
once again on the door. "No," said Gregor. In the neighbouring room
on the left a painful stillness descended. In the neighbouring room
on the right the sister began to sob.</p>
<p>Why didn't his sister go to the others? She'd probably just
gotten up out of bed now and hadn't even started to get dressed
yet. Then why was she crying? Because he wasn't getting up and
wasn't letting the manager in, because he was in danger of losing
his position, and because then his boss would badger his parents
once again with the old demands? Those were probably unnecessary
worries right now. Gregor was still here and wasn't thinking at all
about abandoning his family. At the moment he was lying right there
on the carpet, and no one who knew about his condition would've
seriously demanded that he let the manager in. But Gregor wouldn't
be casually dismissed right way because of this small discourtesy,
for which he would find an easy and suitable excuse later on. It
seemed to Gregor that it might be far more reasonable to leave him
in peace at the moment, instead of disturbing him with crying and
conversation. But it was the very uncertainty which distressed the
others and excused their behaviour.</p>
<p>"Mr. Samsa," the manager was now shouting, his voice raised,
"what's the matter? You are barricading yourself in your room,
answer with only a yes and a no, are making serious and unnecessary
troubles for your parents, and neglecting (I mention this only
incidentally) your commercial duties in a truly unheard of manner.
I am speaking here in the name of your parents and your employer,
and I am requesting you in all seriousness for an immediate and
clear explanation. I am amazed. I am amazed. I thought I knew you
as a calm, reasonable person, and now you appear suddenly to want
to start parading around in weird moods. The Chief indicated to me
earlier this very day a possible explanation for your neglect—it
concerned the collection of cash entrusted to you a short while
ago—but in truth I almost gave him my word of honour that this
explanation could not be correct. However, now I see here your
unimaginable pig headedness, and I am totally losing any desire to
speak up for you in the slightest. And your position is not at all
the most secure. Originally I intended to mention all this to you
privately, but since you are letting me waste my time here
uselessly, I don't know why the matter shouldn't come to the
attention of your parents. Your productivity has also been very
unsatisfactory recently. Of course, it's not the time of year to
conduct exceptional business, we recognize that, but a time of year
for conducting no business, there is no such thing at all, Mr.
Samsa, and such a thing must never be."</p>
<p>"But Mr. Manager," called Gregor, beside himself and, in his
agitation, forgetting everything else, "I'm opening the door
immediately, this very moment. A slight indisposition, a dizzy
spell, has prevented me from getting up. I'm still lying in bed
right now. But I'm quite refreshed once again. I'm in the midst of
getting out of bed. Just have patience for a short moment! Things
are not going as well as I thought. But things are all right. How
suddenly this can overcome someone! Only yesterday evening
everything was fine with me. My parents certainly know that.
Actually just yesterday evening I had a small premonition. People
must have seen that in me. Why have I not reported that to the
office? But people always think that they'll get over sickness
without having to stay at home. Mr. Manager! Take it easy on my
parents! There is really no basis for the criticisms which you're
now making against me, and really nobody has said a word to me
about that. Perhaps you have not read the latest orders which I
shipped. Besides, now I'm setting out on my trip on the eight
o'clock train; the few hours' rest have made me stronger. Mr.
Manager, do not stay. I will be at the office in person right away.
Please have the goodness to say that and to convey my respects to
the Chief."</p>
<p>While Gregor was quickly blurting all this out, hardly aware of
what he was saying, he had moved close to the chest of drawers
without effort, probably as a result of the practice he had already
had in bed, and now he was trying to raise himself up on it.
Actually, he wanted to open the door. He really wanted to let
himself be seen by and to speak with the manager. He was keen to
witness what the others now asking about him would say when they
saw him. If they were startled, then Gregor had no more
responsibility and could be calm. But if they accepted everything
quietly, then he would have no reason to get excited and, if he got
a move on, could really be at the station around eight o'clock.</p>
<p>At first he slid down a few times on the smooth chest of
drawers. But at last he gave himself a final swing and stood
upright there. He was no longer at all aware of the pains in his
lower body, no matter how they might still sting. Now he let
himself fall against the back of a nearby chair, on the edge of
which he braced himself with his thin limbs. By doing this he
gained control over himself and kept quiet, for he could now hear
the manager.</p>
<p>"Did you understood a single word?" the manager asked the
parents, "Is he playing the fool with us?" "For God's sake," cried
the mother already in tears, "perhaps he's very ill and we're
upsetting him. Grete! Grete!" she yelled at that point. "Mother?"
called the sister from the other side. They were making themselves
understood through Gregor's room. "You must go to the doctor right
away. Gregor is sick. Hurry to the doctor. Have you heard Gregor
speak yet?" "That was an animal's voice," said the manager,
remarkably quietly in comparison to the mother's cries.</p>
<p>"Anna! Anna!' yelled the father through the hall into the
kitchen, clapping his hands, "fetch a locksmith right away!" The
two young women were already running through the hall with swishing
skirts—how had his sister dressed herself so quickly?—and yanked
open the doors of the apartment. One couldn't hear the doors
closing at all. They probably had left them open, as is customary
in an apartment where a huge misfortune has taken place.</p>
<p>However, Gregor had become much calmer. All right, people did
not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear
enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because his ears
had gotten used to them. But at least people now thought that
things were not all right with him and were prepared to help him.
The confidence and assurance with which the first arrangements had
been carried out made him feel good. He felt himself included once
again in the circle of humanity and was expecting from both the
doctor and the locksmith, without differentiating between them with
any real precision, splendid and surprising results. In order to
get as clear a voice as possible for the critical conversation
which was imminent, he coughed a little, and certainly took the
trouble to do this in a really subdued way, since it was possible
that even this noise sounded like something different from a human
cough. He no longer trusted himself to decide any more. Meanwhile
in the next room it had become really quiet. Perhaps his parents
were sitting with the manager at the table whispering; perhaps they
were all leaning against the door listening.</p>
<p>Gregor pushed himself slowly towards the door, with the help of
the easy chair, let go of it there, threw himself against the door,
held himself upright against it—the balls of his tiny limbs had a
little sticky stuff on them—and rested there momentarily from his
exertion. Then he made an effort to turn the key in the lock with
his mouth. Unfortunately it seemed that he had no real teeth. How
then was he to grab hold of the key? But to make up for that his
jaws were naturally very strong; with their help he managed to get
the key really moving. He didn't notice that he was obviously
inflicting some damage on himself, for a brown fluid came out of
his mouth, flowed over the key, and dripped onto the floor.</p>
<p>"Just listen for a moment," said the manager in the next room;
"he's turning the key." For Gregor that was a great encouragement.
But they all should've called out to him, including his father and
mother, "Come on, Gregor," they should've shouted; "keep going,
keep working on the lock." Imagining that all his efforts were
being followed with suspense, he bit down frantically on the key
with all the force he could muster. As the key turned more, he
danced around the lock. Now he was holding himself upright only
with his mouth, and he had to hang onto the key or then press it
down again with the whole weight of his body, as necessary. The
quite distinct click of the lock as it finally snapped really woke
Gregor up. Breathing heavily he said to himself, "So I didn't need
the locksmith," and he set his head against the door handle to open
the door completely.</p>
<p>Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already open
very wide without him yet being really visible. He first had to
turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, very carefully, of
course, if he didn't want to fall awkwardly on his back right at
the entrance into the room. He was still preoccupied with this
difficult movement and had no time to pay attention to anything
else, when he heard the manager exclaim a loud "Oh!"—it sounded
like the wind whistling—and now he saw him, nearest to the door,
pressing his hand against his open mouth and moving slowly back, as
if an invisible constant force was pushing him away. His mother—in
spite of the presence of the manager she was standing here with her
hair sticking up on end, still a mess from the night—was looking at
his father with her hands clasped. She then went two steps towards
Gregor and collapsed right in the middle of her skirts, which were
spread out all around her, her face sunk on her breast, completely
concealed. His father clenched his fist with a hostile expression,
as if he wished to push Gregor back into his room, then looked
uncertainly around the living room, covered his eyes with his
hands, and cried so that his mighty breast shook.</p>
<p>At this point Gregor did not take one step into the room, but
leaned his body from the inside against the firmly bolted wing of
the door, so that only half his body was visible, as well as his
head, tilted sideways, with which he peeped over at the others.
Meanwhile it had become much brighter. Standing out clearly from
the other side of the street was a part of the endless grey-black
house situated opposite—it was a hospital—with its severe regular
windows breaking up the facade. The rain was still coming down, but
only in large individual drops visibly and firmly thrown down one
by one onto the ground. The breakfast dishes were standing piled
around on the table, because for his father breakfast was the most
important meal time in the day, which he prolonged for hours by
reading various newspapers. Directly across on the opposite wall
hung a photograph of Gregor from the time of his military service;
it was a picture of him as a lieutenant, as he, smiling and worry
free, with his hand on his sword, demanded respect for his bearing
and uniform. The door to the hall was ajar, and since the door to
the apartment was also open, one could see out into the landing of
the apartment and the start of the staircase going down.</p>
<p>"Now," said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one who had
kept his composure. "I'll get dressed right away, pack up the
collection of samples, and set off. You'll allow me to set out on
my way, will you not? You see, Mr. Manager, I am not pig-headed,
and I am happy to work. Travelling is exhausting, but I couldn't
live without it. Where are you going, Mr. Manager? To the office?
Really? Will you report everything truthfully? A person can be
incapable of work momentarily, but that's precisely the best time
to remember the earlier achievements and to consider that later,
after the obstacles have been shoved aside, the person will work
all the more eagerly and intensely. I am really so indebted to Mr.
Chief—you know that perfectly well. On the other hand, I am
concerned about my parents and my sister. I'm in a fix, but I'll
work myself out of it again. Don't make things more difficult for
me than they already are. Speak up on my behalf in the office!
People don't like travelling salesmen. I know that. People think
they earn pots of money and thus lead a fine life. People don't
even have any special reason to think through this judgment more
clearly. But you, Mr. Manager, you have a better perspective on
what's involved than other people, even, I tell you in total
confidence, a better perspective than Mr. Chairman himself, who in
his capacity as the employer may let his judgment make casual
mistakes at the expense of an employee. You also know well enough
that the travelling salesman who is outside the office almost the
entire year can become so easily a victim of gossip, coincidences,
and groundless complaints, against which it's impossible for him to
defend himself, since for the most part he doesn't hear about them
at all and only then when he's exhausted after finishing a trip and
at home gets to feel in his own body the nasty consequences, which
can't be thoroughly explored back to their origins. Mr. Manager,
don't leave without speaking a word telling me that you'll at least
concede that I'm a little in the right!"</p>
<p>But at Gregor's first words the manager had already turned away,
and now he looked back at Gregor over his twitching shoulders with
pursed lips. During Gregor's speech he was not still for a moment
but kept moving away towards the door, without taking his eyes off
Gregor, but really gradually, as if there was a secret ban on
leaving the room. He was already in the hall, and given the sudden
movement with which he finally pulled his foot out of the living
room, one could have believed that he had just burned the sole of
his foot. In the hall, however, he stretched his right hand out
away from his body towards the staircase, as if some truly
supernatural relief was waiting for him there.</p>
<p>Gregor realized that he must not under any circumstances allow
the manager to go away in this frame of mind, especially if his
position in the firm was not to be placed in the greatest danger.
His parents did not understand all this very well. Over the long
years, they had developed the conviction that Gregor was set up for
life in his firm and, in addition, they had so much to do nowadays
with their present troubles that all foresight was foreign to them.
But Gregor had this foresight. The manager must be held back,
calmed down, convinced, and finally won over. The future of Gregor
and his family really depended on it! If only the sister had been
there! She was clever. She had already cried while Gregor was still
lying quietly on his back. And the manager, this friend of the
ladies, would certainly let himself be guided by her. She would
have closed the door to the apartment and talked him out of his
fright in the hall. But the sister was not even there. Gregor must
deal with it himself.</p>
<p>Without thinking that as yet he didn't know anything about his
present ability to move and that his speech possibly—indeed
probably—had once again not been understood, he left the wing of
the door, pushed himself through the opening, and wanted to go over
to the manager, who was already holding tight onto the handrail
with both hands on the landing in a ridiculous way. But as he
looked for something to hold onto, with a small scream Gregor
immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs. Scarcely had
this happened, when he felt for the first time that morning a
general physical well being. The small limbs had firm floor under
them; they obeyed perfectly, as he noticed to his joy, and strove
to carry him forward in the direction he wanted. Right away he
believed that the final amelioration of all his suffering was
immediately at hand. But at the very moment when he lay on the
floor rocking in a restrained manner quite close and directly
across from his mother, who had apparently totally sunk into
herself, she suddenly sprang right up with her arms spread far
apart and her fingers extended and cried out, "Help, for God's
sake, help!" She held her head bowed down, as if she wanted to view
Gregor better, but ran senselessly back, contradicting that
gesture, forgetting that behind her stood the table with all the
dishes on it. When she reached the table, she sat down heavily on
it, as if absent-mindedly, and did not appear to notice at all that
next to her coffee was pouring out onto the carpet in a full stream
from the large overturned container.</p>
<p>"Mother, mother," said Gregor quietly, and looked over towards
her. The manager momentarily had disappeared completely from his
mind. At the sight of the flowing coffee Gregor couldn't stop
himself snapping his jaws in the air a few times . At that his
mother screamed all over again, hurried from the table, and
collapsed into the arms of his father, who was rushing towards her.
But Gregor had no time right now for his parents—the manager was
already on the staircase. His chin level with the banister, the
manager looked back for the last time. Gregor took an initial
movement to catch up to him if possible. But the manager must have
suspected something, because he made a leap down over a few stairs
and disappeared, still shouting "Huh!" The sound echoed throughout
the entire stairwell.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately this flight of the manager also seemed to
bewilder his father completely. Earlier he had been relatively
calm, for instead of running after the manager himself or at least
not hindering Gregor from his pursuit, with his right hand he
grabbed hold of the manager's cane, which he had left behind with
his hat and overcoat on a chair. With his left hand, his father
picked up a large newspaper from the table and, stamping his feet
on the floor, he set out to drive Gregor back into his room by
waving the cane and the newspaper. No request of Gregor's was of
any use; no request would even be understood. No matter how willing
he was to turn his head respectfully, his father just stomped all
the harder with his feet.</p>
<p>Across the room from him his mother had pulled open a window, in
spite of the cool weather, and leaning out with her hands on her
cheeks, she pushed her face far outside the window. Between the
alley and the stairwell a strong draught came up, the curtains on
the window flew around, the newspapers on the table swished, and
individual sheets fluttered down over the floor. The father
relentlessly pressed forward, pushing out sibilants, like a wild
man. Now, Gregor had no practice at all in going backwards—it was
really very slow going. If Gregor only had been allowed to turn
himself around, he would have been in his room right away, but he
was afraid to make his father impatient by the time-consuming
process of turning around, and each moment he faced the threat of a
mortal blow on his back or his head from the cane in his father's
hand. Finally Gregor had no other option, for he noticed with
horror that he did not understand yet how to maintain his direction
going backwards. And so he began, amid constantly anxious sideways
glances in his father's direction, to turn himself around as
quickly as possible, although in truth this was only done very
slowly. Perhaps his father noticed his good intentions, for he did
not disrupt Gregor in this motion, but with the tip of the cane
from a distance he even directed Gregor's rotating movement here
and there.</p>
<p>If only his father had not hissed so unbearably! Because of that
Gregor totally lost his head. He was already almost totally turned
around, when, always with this hissing in his ear, he just made a
mistake and turned himself back a little. But when he finally was
successful in getting his head in front of the door opening, it
became clear that his body was too wide to go through any further.
Naturally his father, in his present mental state, had no idea of
opening the other wing of the door a bit to create a suitable
passage for Gregor to get through. His single fixed thought was
that Gregor must get into his room as quickly as possible. He would
never have allowed the elaborate preparations that Gregor required
to orient himself and thus perhaps get through the door. On the
contrary, as if there were no obstacle and with a peculiar noise,
he now drove Gregor forwards. Behind Gregor the sound at this point
was no longer like the voice of only a single father. Now it was
really no longer a joke, and Gregor forced himself, come what
might, into the door. One side of his body was lifted up. He lay at
an angle in the door opening. His one flank was sore with the
scraping. On the white door ugly blotches were left. Soon he was
stuck fast and would have not been able to move any more on his
own. The tiny legs on one side hung twitching in the air above, and
the ones on the other side were pushed painfully into the floor.
Then his father gave him one really strong liberating push from
behind, and he scurried, bleeding severely, far into the interior
of his room. The door was slammed shut with the cane, and finally
it was quiet.</p>
