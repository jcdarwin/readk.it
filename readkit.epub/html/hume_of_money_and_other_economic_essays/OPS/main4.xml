<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ONEY is not,
properly speaking, one of the subjects of commerce; but only the
instrument which men have agreed upon to facilitate the exchange of
one commodity for another. It is none of the wheels of trade: It is
the oil which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and
easy. If we consider any one kingdom by itself, it is evident, that
the greater or less plenty of money is of no consequence; since the
prices of commodities are always proportioned to the plenty of
money, and a crown in Harry VII.’s time served the same purpose as
a pound does at present. It is only the public which draws any
advantage from the greater plenty of money; and that only in its
wars and negociations with foreign states. And this is the reason,
why all rich and trading countries from Carthage to Great Britain
and Holland, have employed mercenary troops, which they hired from
their poorer neighbours. Were they to make use of their native
subjects, they would find less advantage from their superior
riches, and from their great plenty of gold and silver; since the
pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public
opulence. Our small army of 20,000 men is maintained at as great
expence as a French army twice as numerous. The English fleet,
during the late war, required as much money to support it as all
the Roman legions, which kept the whole world in subjection, during
the time of the emperors.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_6" id="footnote_6_call">[6]</a></p>
<p>The greater number of people and their greater industry are
serviceable in all cases; at home and abroad, in private, and in
public. But the greater plenty of money, is very limited in its
use, and may even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its commerce
with foreigners.</p>
<p>There seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human
affairs, which checks the growth of trade and riches, and hinders
them from being confined entirely to one people; as might naturally
at first be dreaded from the advantages of an established commerce.
Where one nation has gotten the start of another in trade, it is
very difficult for the latter to regain the ground it has lost;
because of the superior industry and skill of the former, and the
greater stocks, of which its merchants are possessed, and which
enable them to trade on so much smaller profits. But these
advantages are compensated, in some measure, by the low price of
labour in every nation which has not an extensive commerce, and
does not much abound in gold and silver. Manufactures, therefore,
gradually shift their places, leaving those countries and provinces
which they have already enriched, and flying to others, whither
they are allured by the cheapness of provisions and labour; till
they have enriched these also, and are again banished by the same
causes. And, in general, we may observe, that the dearness of every
thing, from plenty of money, is a disadvantage, which attends an
established commerce, and sets bounds to it in every country, by
enabling the poorer states to undersel the richer in all foreign
markets.</p>
<p>This has made me entertain a doubt concerning the benefit of
banks and paper-credit, which are so generally esteemed
advantageous to every nation. That provisions and labour should
become dear by the encrease of trade and money, is, in many
respects, an inconvenience; but an inconvenience that is
unavoidable, and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity
which are the end of all our wishes. It is compensated by the
advantages, which we reap from the possession of these precious
metals, and the weight, which they give the nation in all foreign
wars and negociations. But there appears no reason for encreasing
that inconvenience by a counterfeit money, which foreigners will
not accept of in any payment, and which any great disorder in the
state will reduce to nothing. There are, it is true, many people in
every rich state, who, having large sums of money, would prefer
paper with good security; as being of more easy transport and more
safe custody. If the public provide not a bank, private bankers
will take advantage of this circumstance; as the goldsmiths
formerly did in London, or as the bankers do at present in Dublin:
And therefore it is better, it may be thought, that a public
company should enjoy the benefit of that paper-credit, which always
will have place in every opulent kingdom. But to endeavour
artificially to encrease such a credit, can never be the interest
of any trading nation; but must lay them under disadvantages, by
encreasing money beyond its natural proportion to labour and
commodities, and thereby heightening their price to the merchant
and manufacturer. And in this view, it must be allowed, that no
bank could be more advantageous, than such a one as locked up all
the money it received,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_7" id="footnote_7_call">[7]</a> and never
augmented the circulating coin, as is usual, by returning part of
its treasure into commerce. A public bank, by this expedient, might
cut off much of the dealings of private bankers and money-jobbers;
and though the state bore the charge of salaries to the directors
and tellers of this bank (for, according to the preceding
supposition, it would have no profit from its dealings), the
national advantage, resulting from the low price of labour and the
destruction of paper-credit, would be a sufficient compensation.
Not to mention, that so large a sum, lying ready at command, would
be a convenience in times of great public danger and distress; and
what part of it was used might be replaced at leisure, when peace
and tranquillity was restored to the nation.</p>
<p>But of this subject of paper credit we shall treat more largely
hereafter. And I shall finish this essay on money, by proposing and
explaining two observations, which may, perhaps, serve to employ
the thoughts of our speculative politicians.</p>
<p>It was a shrewd observation of Anacharsis<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_8" id="footnote_8_call">[8]</a> the
Scythian, who had never seen money in his own country, that gold
and silver seemed to him of no use to the Greeks, but to assist
them in numeration and arithmetic. It is indeed evident, that money
is nothing but the representation of labour and commodities, and
serves only as a method of rating or estimating them. Where coin is
in greater plenty; as a greater quantity of it is required to
represent the same quantity of goods; it can have no effect, either
good or bad, taking a nation within itself; any more than it would
make an alteration on a merchant’s books, if, instead of the
Arabian method of notation, which requires few characters, he
should make use of the Roman, which requires a great many. Nay, the
greater quantity of money, like the Roman characters, is rather
inconvenient, and requires greater trouble both to keep and
transport it. But notwithstanding this conclusion, which must be
allowed just, it is certain, that, since the discovery of the mines
in America, industry has encreased in all the nations of Europe,
except in the possessors of those mines; and this may justly be
ascribed, amongst other reasons, to the encrease of gold and
silver. Accordingly we find, that, in every kingdom, into which
money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly, every
thing takes a new face: labour and industry gain life; the merchant
becomes more enterprising, the manufacturer more diligent and
skilful, and even the farmer follows his plough with greater
alacrity and attention. This is not easily to be accounted for, if
we consider only the influence which a greater abundance of coin
has in the kingdom itself, by heightening the price of commodities,
and obliging every one to pay a greater number of these little
yellow or white pieces for every thing he purchases. And as to
foreign trade, it appears, that great plenty of money is rather
disadvantageous, by raising the price of every kind of labour.</p>
<p>To account, then, for this phenomenon, we must consider, that
though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of
the encrease of gold and silver, yet it follows not immediately
upon that encrease; but some time is required before the money
circulates through the whole state, and makes its effect be felt on
all ranks of people. At first, no alteration is perceived; by
degrees the price rises, first of one commodity, then of another;
till the whole at last reaches a just proportion with the new
quantity of specie which is in the kingdom. In my opinion, it is
only in this interval or intermediate situation, between the
acquisition of money and rise of prices, that the encreasing
quantity of gold and silver is favourable to industry. When any
quantity of money is imported into a nation, it is not at first
dispersed into many hands; but is confined to the coffers of a few
persons, who immediately seek to employ it to advantage. Here are a
set of manufacturers or merchants, we shall suppose, who have
received returns of gold and silver for goods which they sent to
Cadiz. They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than
formerly, who never dream of demanding higher wages, but are glad
of employment from such good paymasters. If workmen become scarce,
the manufacturer gives higher wages, but at first requires an
encrease of labour; and this is willingly submitted to by the
artisan, who can now eat and drink better, to compensate his
additional toil and fatigue. He carries his money to market, where
he finds every thing at the same price as formerly, but returns
with greater quantity and of better kinds, for the use of his
family. The farmer and gardener, finding, that all their
commodities are taken off, apply themselves with alacrity to the
raising more; and at the same time can afford to take better and
more cloths from their tradesmen, whose price is the same as
formerly, and their industry only whetted by so much new gain. It
is easy to trace the money in its progress through the whole
commonwealth; where we shall find, that it must first quicken the
diligence of every individual, before it encrease the price of
labour.</p>
<p>And that the specie may encrease to a considerable pitch, before
it have this latter effect, appears, amongst other instances, from
the frequent operations of the French king on the money; where it
was always found, that the augmenting of the numerary value did not
produce a proportional rise of the prices, at least for some time.
In the last year of Louis XIV. money was raised three-sevenths, but
prices augmented only one. Corn in France is now sold at the same
price, or for the same number of livres, it was in 1683; though
silver was then at 30 livres the mark, and is now at 50.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_9" id=
"footnote_9_call">[9]</a> Not to mention the great addition of gold
and silver, which may have come into that kingdom since the former
period.</p>
<p>From the whole of this reasoning we may conclude, that it is of
no manner of consequence, with regard to the domestic happiness of
a state, whether money be in a greater or less quantity. The good
policy of the magistrate consists only in keeping it, if possible,
still encreasing; because, by that means, he keeps alive a spirit
of industry in the nation, and encreases the stock of labour, in
which consists all real power and riches. A nation, whose money
decreases, is actually, at that time, weaker and more miserable
than another nation, which possesses no more money, but is on the
encreasing hand. This will be easily accounted for, if we consider,
that the alterations in the quantity of money, either on one side
or the other, are not immediately attended with proportionable
alterations in the price of commodities. There is always an
interval before matters be adjusted to their new situation; and
this interval is as pernicious to industry, when gold and silver
are diminishing, as it is advantageous when these metals are
encreasing. The workman has not the same employment from the
manufacturer and merchant; though he pays the same price for every
thing in the market. The farmer cannot dispose of his corn and
cattle; though he must pay the same rent to his landlord. The
poverty, and beggary, and sloth, which must ensue, are easily
foreseen.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The second observation which I proposed to make with regard to
money, may be explained after the following manner. There are some
kingdoms, and many provinces in Europe, (and all of them were once
in the same condition) where money is so scarce, that the landlord
can get none at all from his tenants; but is obliged to take his
rent in kind, and either to consume it himself, or transport it to
places where he may find a market. In those countries, the prince
can levy few or no taxes, but in the same manner: And as he will
receive small benefit from impositions so paid, it is evident that
such a kingdom has little force even at home; and cannot maintain
fleets and armies to the same extent, as if every part of it
abounded in gold and silver. There is surely a greater
disproportion between the force of Germany, at present, and what it
was three centuries ago,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_10" id="footnote_10_call">[10]</a> than
there is in its industry, people, and manufactures. The Austrian
dominions in the empire are in general well peopled and well
cultivated, and are of great extent; but have not a proportionable
weight in the balance of Europe; proceeding, as is commonly
supposed, from the scarcity of money. How do all these facts agree
with that principle of reason, that the quantity of gold and silver
is in itself altogether indifferent? According to that principle,
wherever a sovereign has numbers of subjects, and these have plenty
of commodities, he should of course be great and powerful, and they
rich and happy, independent of the greater or lesser abundance of
the precious metals. These admit of divisions and subdivisions to a
great extent; and where the pieces might become so small as to be
in danger of being lost, it is easy to mix the gold or silver with
a baser metal, as is practised in some countries of Europe; and by
that means raise the pieces to a bulk more sensible and convenient.
They still serve the same purposes of exchange, whatever their
number may be, or whatever colour they may be supposed to have.</p>
<p>To these difficulties I answer, that the effect, here supposed
to flow from scarcity of money, really arises from the manners and
customs of the people; and that we mistake, as is too usual, a
collateral effect for a cause. The contradiction is only apparent;
but it requires some thought and reflection to discover the
principles, by which we can reconcile reason to experience.</p>
<p>It seems a maxim almost self-evident, that the prices of every
thing depend on the proportion between commodities and money, and
that any considerable alteration on either has the same effect,
either of heightening or lowering the price. Encrease the
commodities, they become cheaper; encrease the money, they rise in
their value. As, on the other hand, a diminution of the former, and
that of the latter, have contrary tendencies.</p>
<p>It is also evident, that the prices do not so much depend on the
absolute quantity of commodities and that of money, which are in a
nation, as on that of the commodities, which come or may come to
market, and of the money which circulates. If the coin be locked up
in chests, it is the same thing with regard to prices, as if it
were annihilated; if the commodities be hoarded in magazines and
granaries, a like effect follows. As the money and commodities, in
these cases, never meet, they cannot affect each other. Were we, at
any time, to form conjectures concerning the price of provisions,
the corn, which the farmer must reserve for seed and for the
maintenance of himself and family, ought never to enter into the
estimation. It is only the overplus, compared to the demand, that
determines the value.</p>
<p>To apply these principles, we must consider, that, in the first
and more uncultivated ages of any state, ere fancy has confounded
her wants with those of nature, men, content with the produce of
their own fields, or with those rude improvements which they
themselves can work upon them, have little occasion for exchange,
at least for money, which, by agreement, is the common measure of
exchange. The wool of the farmer’s own flock, spun in his own
family, and wrought by a neighbouring weaver, who receives his
payment in corn or wool, suffices for furniture and cloathing. The
carpenter, the smith, the mason, the tailor, are retained by wages
of a like nature; and the landlord himself, dwelling in the
neighbourhood, is content to receive his rent in the commodities
raised by the farmer. The greater part of these he consumes at
home, in rustic hospitality: The rest, perhaps, he disposes of for
money to the neighbouring town, whence he draws the few materials
of his expence and luxury.</p>
<p>But after men begin to refine on all these enjoyments, and live
not always at home, nor are content with what can be raised in
their neighbourhood, there is more exchange and commerce of all
kinds, and more money enters into that exchange. The tradesmen will
not be paid in corn; because they want something more than barely
to eat. The farmer goes beyond his own parish for the commodities
he purchases, and cannot always carry his commodities to the
merchant who supplies him. The landlord lives in the capital, or in
a foreign country; and demands his rent in gold and silver, which
can easily be transported to him. Great undertakers, and
manufacturers, and merchants, arise in every commodity; and these
can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie. And consequently,
in this situation of society, the coin enters into many more
contracts, and by that means is much more employed than in the
former.</p>
<p>The necessary effect is, that, provided the money encrease not
in the nation, every thing must become much cheaper in times of
industry and refinement, than in rude, uncultivated ages. It is the
proportion between the circulating money, and the commodities in
the market, which determines the prices. Goods, that are consumed
at home, or exchanged with other goods in the neighbourhood, never
come to market; they affect not in the least the current specie;
with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated; and
consequently this method of using them sinks the proportion on the
side of the commodities, and encreases the prices. But after money
enters into all contracts and sales, and is every where the measure
of exchange, the same national cash has a much greater task to
perform; all commodities are then in the market; the sphere of
circulation is enlarged; it is the same case as if that individual
sum were to serve a larger kingdom; and therefore, the proportion
being here lessened on the side of the money, every thing must
become cheaper, and the prices gradually fall.</p>
<p>By the most exact computations, that have been formed all over
Europe, after making allowance for the alteration in the numerary
value or the denomination, it is found, that the prices of all
things have only risen three, or at most, four times, since the
discovery of the West Indies. But will any one assert, that there
is not much more than four times the coin in Europe, that was in
the fifteenth century, and the centuries preceding it? The
Spaniards and Portuguese from their mines, the English, French, and
Dutch, by their African trade, and by their interlopers in the West
Indies, bring home about six millions a year, of which not above a
third goes to the East Indies. This sum alone, in ten years, would
probably double the ancient stock of money in Europe. And no other
satisfactory reason can be given, why all prices have not risen to
a much more exorbitant height, except that which is derived from a
change of customs and manners. Besides that more commodities are
produced by additional industry, the same commodities come more to
market, after men depart from their ancient simplicity of
manners.</p>
<p>And though this encrease has not been equal to that of money, it
has, however, been considerable, and has preserved the proportion
between coin and commodities nearer the ancient standard.</p>
<p>Were the question proposed, Which of these methods of living in
the people, the simple or refined, is the most advantageous to the
state or public? I should, without much scruple, prefer the latter,
in a view to politics at least; and should produce this as an
additional reason for the encouragement of trade and
manufactures.</p>
<p>While men live in the ancient simple manner, and supply all
their necessaries from domestic industry or from the neighbourhood,
the sovereign can levy no taxes in money from a considerable part
of his subjects; and if he will impose on them any burthens, he
must take payment in commodities, with which alone they abound; a
method attended with such great and obvious inconveniencies, that
they need not here be insisted on. All the money he can pretend to
raise, must be from his principal cities, where alone it
circulates; and these, it is evident, cannot afford him so much as
the whole state could, did gold and silver circulate throughout the
whole. But besides this obvious diminution of the revenue, there is
another cause of the poverty of the public in such a situation. Not
only the sovereign receives less money, but the same money goes not
so far as in times of industry and general commerce. Every thing is
dearer, where the gold and silver are supposed equal; and that
because fewer commodities come to market, and the whole coin bears
a higher proportion to what is to be purchased by it; whence alone
the prices of every thing are fixed and determined.</p>
<p>Here then we may learn the fallacy of the remark, often to be
met with in historians, and even in common conversation, that any
particular state is weak, though fertile, populous, and well
cultivated, merely because it wants money. It appears, that the
want of money can never injure any state within itself: For men and
commodities are the real strength of any community. It is the
simple manner of living which here hurts the public, by confining
the gold and silver to few hands, and preventing its universal
diffusion and circulation. On the contrary, industry and
refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole state,
however small its quantity may be: They digest it into every vein,
so to speak; and make it enter into every transaction and contract.
No hand is entirely empty of it. And as the prices of every thing
fall by that means, the sovereign has a double advantage: He may
draw money by his taxes from every part of the state; and what he
receives, goes farther in every purchase and payment.</p>
<p>We may infer, from a comparison of prices, that money is not
more plentiful in China, than it was in Europe three centuries ago:
But what immense power is that empire possessed of, if we may judge
by the civil and military establishment maintained by it?
Polybius<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_11" id=
"footnote_11_call">[11]</a> tells us, that provisions were so cheap
in Italy during his time, that in some places the stated price for
a meal at the inns was a semis a head, little more than a farthing!
Yet the Roman power had even then subdued the whole known world.
About a century before that period, the Carthaginian ambassador
said, by way of raillery, that no people lived more sociably
amongst themselves than the Romans; for that, in every
entertainment, which, as foreign ministers, they received, they
still observed the same plate at every table.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_12" id="footnote_12_call">[12]</a> The
absolute quantity of the precious metals is a matter of great
indifference. There are only two circumstances of any importance,
namely, their gradual encrease, and their thorough concoction and
circulation through the state; and the influence of both these
circumstances has here been explained.</p>
<p>In the following Essay we shall see an instance of a like
fallacy as that above mentioned; where a collateral effect is taken
for a cause, and where a consequence is ascribed to the plenty of
money; though it be really owing to a change in the manners and
customs of the people.</p>
