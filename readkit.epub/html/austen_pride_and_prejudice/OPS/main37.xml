<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f Elizabeth, when
Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a
renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its
contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how
eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion
they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any
apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that
he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame
would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he
might say, she began his account of what had happened at
Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power
of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility
she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real,
the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.
It was all pride and insolence.</p>
<p>But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.
Wickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of
events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of
his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own
history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and
more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even
horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,
repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This
must be the grossest falsehood!"—and when she had gone through the
whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or
two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it,
that she would never look in it again.</p>
<p>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest
on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute
the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as
she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that
related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the
meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the
Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the
kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its
extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital
confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference
was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her
memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not
to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other;
and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention,
the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all
pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable
a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she
meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each
statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only
assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly
that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any
contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in
it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him
entirely blameless throughout the whole.</p>
<p>The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to
lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so,
as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard
of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he
had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him
accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of
his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but
what he told himself. As to his real character, had information
been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His
countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the
possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of
goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence,
that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least,
by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under
which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as
the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such
recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no
more substantial good than the general approbation of the
neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained
him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while,
she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which
followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation
from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only
the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of
every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had
previously received the information of his near concern in all his
cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to
question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him,
but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would
never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well
assured of his cousin's corroboration.</p>
<p>She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in
conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at
Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her
memory. She was&#160;<em>now</em>&#160;struck with the impropriety
of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped
her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he
had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his
conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of
seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but
that&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;should stand his ground; yet he had
avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered
also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he
had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their
removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no
reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he
had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent
his exposing the son.</p>
<p>How differently did everything now appear in which he was
concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of
views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her
fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his
eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now
have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with
regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by
encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew
fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she
could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long
ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and
repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course
of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought
them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his
ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or
unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even
Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often
heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him
capable of&#160;<em>some</em>amiable feeling; that had his actions
been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world;
and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an
amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor
Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,
partial, prejudiced, absurd.</p>
<p>"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided
myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my
abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my
sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!
How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had
I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But
vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of
one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very
beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and
ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.
Till this moment I never knew myself."</p>
<p>From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in
a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's
explanation&#160;<em>there</em>&#160;had appeared very
insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the
effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his
assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in
the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what
Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the
justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings,
though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with
great sensibility.</p>
<p>When she came to that part of the letter in which her family
were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach,
her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her
too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he
particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and
as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a
stronger impression on his mind than on hers.</p>
<p>The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It
soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had
thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she
considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of
her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of
both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt
depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.</p>
<p>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to
every variety of thought—re-considering events, determining
probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a
change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of
her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered
the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the
resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit
for conversation.</p>
<p>She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had
each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes,
to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with
them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving
to walk after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but
just&#160;<em>affect</em>&#160;concern in missing him; she really
rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she
could think only of her letter.</p>
