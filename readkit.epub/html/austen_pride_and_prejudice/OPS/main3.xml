<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ot all that Mrs.
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could
ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any
satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in
various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they
were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of
their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir
William had been delighted with him. He was quite young,
wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole,
he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing
could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step
towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's
heart were entertained.</p>
<p>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at
Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others
equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</p>
<p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat
about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes
of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty
he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were
somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining
from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black
horse.</p>
<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and
already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit
to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.
Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and,
consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.
Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what
business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in
Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying
about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield
as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by
starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large
party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was
to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the
assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were
comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of
twelve he brought only six with him from London—his five sisters
and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it
consisted of only five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the
husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a
pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters
were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His
brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his
friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine,
tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which
was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance,
of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to
be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much
handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a
disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was
discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being
pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save
him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and
being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the
principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced
every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of
giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must
speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend!
Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss
Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the
rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking
occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He
was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody
hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most
violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general
behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having
slighted one of her daughters.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,
to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy
had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation
between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few
minutes, to press his friend to join it.</p>
<p>"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see
you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much
better dance."</p>
<p>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as
this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there
is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment
to me to stand up with."</p>
<p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley,
"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant
girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of
them you see uncommonly pretty."</p>
<p>"<em>You</em>&#160;are dancing with the only handsome girl in
the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.</p>
<p>"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there
is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very
pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to
introduce you."</p>
<p>"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly
said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to
tempt&#160;<em>me</em>; I am in no humour at present to give
consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had
better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are
wasting your time with me."</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and
Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She
told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for
she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything
ridiculous.</p>
<p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole
family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by
the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and
she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much
gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to
Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood;
and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be
without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care
for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to
Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the
principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book
he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had
raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his
wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon
found out that he had a different story to hear.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had
a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had
been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her
quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think
of&#160;<em>that</em>, my dear; he actually danced with her twice!
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him
stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all;
indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane
as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and
got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third
he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and
the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and
the<em>Boulanger</em>—"</p>
<p>"If he had had any compassion for&#160;<em>me</em>," cried her
husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For
God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his
ankle in the first dance!"</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so
excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say
the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown—"</p>
<p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another
branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit
and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</p>
<p>"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose
much by not suiting&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;fancy; for he is a most
disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so
conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he
walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough
to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given
him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."</p>
