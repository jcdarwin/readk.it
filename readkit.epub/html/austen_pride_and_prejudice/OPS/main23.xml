<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth was
sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had
heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when
Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to
them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection
between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an audience not
merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more
perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely
mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,
boisterously exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not
you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"</p>
<p>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have
borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding
carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be
positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all
their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so
unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his
account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte
herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her
mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir
William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a
variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the
match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient
distance of Hunsford from London.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal
while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her
feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in
disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure
that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they
would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might
be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from
the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief;
and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them
all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest
of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her.
Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she
could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away
before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being
rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive
their daughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,
and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most
agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that
Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible,
was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!</p>
<p>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she
said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their
happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as
improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for
Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other
way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.</p>
<p>Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to
retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well
married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to
say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and
ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness
away.</p>
<p>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept
them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded
that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion
could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more
anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was
heard of his return.</p>
<p>Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was
counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The
promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday,
addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of
gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have
prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he
proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his
happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable
neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with
the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close
with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he
hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to
take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an
unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early
day for making him the happiest of men.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter
of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much
disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that
he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also
very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having
visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and
lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the
gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the
greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.</p>
<p>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day
after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him
than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no
more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly
incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a
most scandalous falsehood.</p>
<p>Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was
indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him
away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of
Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her
lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united
efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering
friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the
amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the
strength of his attachment.</p>
<p>As for Jane,&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;anxiety under this suspense
was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she
felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and
Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no
such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which
she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his
arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come
back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's
steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but
his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been
on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much
attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making
relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every
day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to
Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before
the family went to bed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very
mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of
ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked
of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in
that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever
Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating
the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to
Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn
estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the
house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of
all this to her husband.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that
Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I
should be forced to make way for&#160;<em>her</em>, and live to see
her take her place in it!"</p>
<p>"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope
for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the
survivor."</p>
<p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,
instead of making any answer, she went on as before.</p>
<p>"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.
If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."</p>
<p>"What should not you mind?"</p>
<p>"I should not mind anything at all."</p>
<p>"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."</p>
<p>"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the
entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an
estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for
the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;have
it more than anybody else?"</p>
<p>"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.</p>
