<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth's
spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to
account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could you
begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the
first place?"</p>
<p>"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the
words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the
middle before I knew that I&#160;<em>had</em>&#160;begun."</p>
<p>"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my
behaviour to&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;was at least always bordering
on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to
give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my
impertinence?"</p>
<p>"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."</p>
<p>"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very
little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of
deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the
women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking
for&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike&#160;<em>them</em>. Had you
not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in
spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings
were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly
despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have
saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things
considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure,
you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks
of&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;when they fall in love."</p>
<p>"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while
she was ill at Netherfield?"</p>
<p>"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a
virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your
protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;
and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and
quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly
by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at
last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and
afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you
look as if you did not care about me?"</p>
<p>"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no
encouragement."</p>
<p>"But I was embarrassed."</p>
<p>"And so was I."</p>
<p>"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."</p>
<p>"A man who had felt less, might."</p>
<p>"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,
and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how
long you&#160;<em>would</em>&#160;have gone on, if you had been
left to yourself. I wonder when you&#160;<em>would</em>&#160;have
spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for
your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.&#160;<em>Too
much</em>, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our
comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have
mentioned the subject. This will never do."</p>
<p>"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly
fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were
the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my
present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your
gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours.
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at
once to know every thing."</p>
<p>"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make
her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you
come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn
and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious
consequence?"</p>
<p>"My real purpose was to see&#160;<em>you</em>, and to judge, if
I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed
one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister
were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the
confession to him which I have since made."</p>
<p>"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what
is to befall her?"</p>
<p>"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But
it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it
shall be done directly."</p>
<p>"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you
and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once
did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer
neglected."</p>
<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.
Gardiner's long letter; but now, having&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;to
communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost
ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days
of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:</p>
<p>"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to
have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of
particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You
supposed more than really existed.
But&#160;<em>now</em>&#160;suppose as much as you choose; give a
loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every
possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you
believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write
again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in
your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the
Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the
ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the
happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane;
she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the
world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley
at Christmas. Yours, etc."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;
and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.
Collins, in reply to his last.</p>
<p>"DEAR SIR,</p>
<p>"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth
will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well
as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has
more to give.</p>
<p>"Yours sincerely, etc."</p>
<p>Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his
approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and
repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived,
but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could
not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was
deserved.</p>
<p>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar
information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four
sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and
all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.</p>
<p>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any
congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family
heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The
reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had
been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's
letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious
to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the
arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though
in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the
pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the
parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it,
however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir
William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the
brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their
all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out
of sight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater,
tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her
sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity
which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever
she&#160;<em>did</em>&#160;speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her
respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to
make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him
from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable
feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship
much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she
looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed
from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and
elegance of their family party at Pemberley.</p>
