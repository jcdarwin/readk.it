<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Wickham was so
perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again
distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by
introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.</p>
<p>The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet
was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no
means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was
likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years,
perhaps."</p>
<p>"Write to me very often, my dear."</p>
<p>"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much
time for writing. My sisters may write to&#160;<em>me</em>. They
will have nothing else to do."</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his
wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty
things.</p>
<p>"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were
out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes
love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir
William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."</p>
<p>The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several
days.</p>
<p>"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as
parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."</p>
<p>"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a
daughter," said Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that
your other four are single."</p>
<p>"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is
married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so
far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so
soon."</p>
<p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of
hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation.
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for
the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to
shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the
fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by
turns.</p>
<p>"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for
Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). "Well, so much the
better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you
know, and I am sure&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;never want to see him
again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if
he likes it. And who knows what&#160;<em>may</em>&#160;happen? But
that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never
to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is
coming?"</p>
<p>"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls
was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out
myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it
was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very
likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me,
on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got
three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without
changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his
name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,
she said:</p>
<p>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the
present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine
it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment,
because I felt that I&#160;<em>should</em>&#160;be looked at. I do
assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or
pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall
see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of&#160;<em>myself</em>,
but I dread other people's remarks."</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him
in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there
with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still
thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater
probability of his coming there&#160;<em>with</em>&#160;his
friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.</p>
<p>"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man
cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising
all this speculation! I&#160;<em>will</em>&#160;leave him to
himself."</p>
<p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be
her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could
easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were
more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.</p>
<p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their
parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward
again.</p>
<p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet,
"you will wait on him of course."</p>
<p>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and
promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my
daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a
fool's errand again."</p>
<p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an
attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his
returning to Netherfield.</p>
<p>"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our
society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend
my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and
come back again."</p>
<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do
not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to
dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the
Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there
will be just room at table for him."</p>
<p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that
her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,
before&#160;<em>they</em>&#160;did. As the day of his arrival drew
near:</p>
<p>"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her
sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect
indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually
talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can
know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when
his stay at Netherfield is over!"</p>
<p>"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth;
"but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me,
because you have always so much."</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of
servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the
period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as
it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their
invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the
third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from
her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the
house.</p>
<p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane
resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy
her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with
him, and sat down again by her sister.</p>
<p>"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it
be?"</p>
<p>"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do
not know."</p>
<p>"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to
be with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any
friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure;
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."</p>
<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but
little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the
awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for
the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters
were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course
for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr.
Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's
friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had
sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom
she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to
relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could
be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she
had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was
the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of
benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not
quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt
for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to
Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was
almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.</p>
<p>The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for
half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added
lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his
affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be
secure.</p>
<p>"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be
early enough for expectation."</p>
<p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without
daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to
the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than
Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour
increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a
propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment
or any unnecessary complaisance.</p>
<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and
sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not
often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked
serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to
look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But,
perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before
her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable,
conjecture.</p>
<p>Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short
period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was
received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her
two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and
ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his
friend.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the
latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable
infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a
distinction so ill applied.</p>
<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a
question which she could not answer without confusion, said
scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the
reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There
he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now
several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice;
and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity,
she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at
Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.
More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last
met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with
herself for being so.</p>
<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he
come?"</p>
<p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;
and to him she had hardly courage to speak.</p>
<p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</p>
<p>"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.
Bennet.</p>
<p>He readily agreed to it.</p>
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
People&#160;<em>did</em>&#160;say you meant to quit the place
entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A
great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you
went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own
daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said,
'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there
being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived,
or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I
wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you
see it?"</p>
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,
therefore, she could not tell.</p>
<p>"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well
married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley,
it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone
down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there
they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for
I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his
being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he
has&#160;<em>some</em>&#160;friends, though perhaps not so many as
he deserves."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in
such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew
from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had
so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant
to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he
believed.</p>
<p>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her
mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please
on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige
you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such
officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at
present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was
persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At
that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane
or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.</p>
<p>"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never
more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford
no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me
never see either one or the other again!"</p>
<p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from
observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the
admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had
spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be
giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she
had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not
quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be
perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked
as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did
not always know when she was silent.</p>
<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of
her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.</p>
<p>"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for
when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family
dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you
see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did
not come back and keep your engagement."</p>
<p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said
something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They
then went away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and
dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table,
she did not think anything less than two courses could be good
enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy
the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.</p>
