<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he two gentlemen
left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in
waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in
very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected,
after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To
Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her
daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction,
a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so
dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with
her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting
that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented
to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile,
of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she
have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which
she amused herself.</p>
<p>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I
assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe
no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am
particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so
much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they
always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till
just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I
think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly
increases."</p>
<p>Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,
which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.</p>
<p>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed
out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by
supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she
added:</p>
<p>"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg
that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad
of your company, I am sure."</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"
replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must
be in town next Saturday."</p>
<p>"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I
expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you
came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet
could certainly spare you for another fortnight."</p>
<p>"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my
return."</p>
<p>"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you
will stay another&#160;<em>month</em>&#160;complete, it will be in
my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there
early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the
barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and
indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not
object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."</p>
<p>"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."</p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must send a
servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It
is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the
greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women
should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their
situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last
summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her.
Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne,
could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am
excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with
the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to
mention it; for it would really be discreditable
to&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;to let them go alone."</p>
<p>"My uncle is to send a servant for us."</p>
<p>"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad
you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you
change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at
the Bell, you will be attended to."</p>
<p>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their
journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was
necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was
alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day
went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all
the delight of unpleasant recollections.</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by
heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its
writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the
style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when
she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,
her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings
became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude,
his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor
could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest
inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there
was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy
defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were
hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them,
would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had
frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence
of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their
mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's
guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia,
self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They
were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in
Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a
walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.</p>
<p>Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection
was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all
blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his
confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that,
of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with
advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by
the folly and indecorum of her own family!</p>
<p>When to these recollections was added the development of
Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy
spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much
affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear
tolerably cheerful.</p>
<p>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening
was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the
particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best
method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing
gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on
her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk
afresh.</p>
<p>When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,
wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford
again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to
curtsey and hold out her hand to both.</p>
