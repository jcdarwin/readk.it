Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr.
Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should
bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a
favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed
like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these
occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward
pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn
back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she
give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it
struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was
asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being
at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and
Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that
whenever she came into Kent again she would be
staying&#160;<em>there</em>&#160;too. His words seemed to imply it.
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if
he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in
that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to
find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.</p>
<p>She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had
not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by
Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was
meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a
smile, she said:</p>
<p>"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."</p>
<p>"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I
generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the
Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"</p>
<p>"No, I should have turned in a moment."</p>
<p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the
Parsonage together.</p>
<p>"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.</p>
<p>"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his
disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases."</p>
<p>"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at
least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody
who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.
Darcy."</p>
<p>"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel
Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means
of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others
are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be
inured to self-denial and dependence."</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little
of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial
and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from
going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy
for?"</p>
<p>"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of
greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons
cannot marry where they like."</p>
<p>"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they
very often do."</p>
<p>"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not
many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some
attention to money."</p>
<p>"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured
at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And
pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the
elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above
fifty thousand pounds."</p>
<p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To
interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with
what had passed, she soon afterwards said:</p>
<p>"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the
sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry,
to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his
sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole
care, he may do what he likes with her."</p>
<p>"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he
must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of
Miss Darcy."</p>
<p>"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are
sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true
Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."</p>
<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the
manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss
Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she
had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly
replied:</p>
<p>"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and
I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance,
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you
know them."</p>
<p>"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike
man—he is a great friend of Darcy's."</p>
<p>"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind
to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."</p>
<p>"Care of him! Yes, I really believe
Darcy&#160;<em>does</em>&#160;take care of him in those points
where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our
journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted
to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to
suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all
conjecture."</p>
<p>"What is it you mean?"</p>
<p>"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally
known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it
would be an unpleasant thing."</p>
<p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."</p>
<p>"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated
himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of
a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any
other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from
believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that
sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last
summer."</p>
<p>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"</p>
<p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections
against the lady."</p>
<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"</p>
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam,
smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why
she was so thoughtful.</p>
<p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be
the judge?"</p>
<p>"You are rather disposed to call his interference
officious?"</p>
<p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the
propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own
judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his
friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself,
"as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the
case."</p>
<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."</p>
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a
picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an
answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on
indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut
into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could
think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to
be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with
whom she was connected. There could not exist in the
world&#160;<em>two</em>&#160;men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the
measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted;
but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design
and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not
mislead him,&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;was the cause, his pride and
caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still
continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of
happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world;
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.</p>
<p>"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were
Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably
were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another
who was in business in London.</p>
<p>"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility
of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her
understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners
captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,
who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy
himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably
never reach." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave
way a little; but she would not allow that any
objections&#160;<em>there</em>&#160;had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound
from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from
their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he
had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by
the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.</p>
<p>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on
a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,
added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not
to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink
tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press
her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from
pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of
Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at
home.</p>
