The Funeral</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!</p>
<p>The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body
of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though
changed in hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is
still colossal. Slowly it floats more and more away, the water
round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air
above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks
are like so many insulting poniards in the whale.The vast white
headless phantom floats further and further from the ship, and
every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and
cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and
hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the
pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of
death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.</p>
<p>There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The
sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all
punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but few of them would
have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it;
but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce.
Oh, horrible vulturism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale
is free.</p>
<p>Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid
man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the
distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the
white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high
against it; straightway the whale’s unharming corpse, with
trembling fingers is set down in the log—shoals, rocks, and
breakers hereabouts: beware! And for years afterwards, perhaps,
ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a
vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there when a stick
was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your utility of
traditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of old
beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in
the air! There’s orthodoxy!</p>
<p>Thus, while in the life the great whale’s body may have been a
real terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless
panic to a world.</p>
<p>Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts
than the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who
believe in them.</p>
