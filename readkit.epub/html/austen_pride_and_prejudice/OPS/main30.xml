<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Collins's
triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power
of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and
his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an
opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an
instance of Lady Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to
admire enough.</p>
<p>"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all
surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and
spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge
of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have
foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we
should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,
moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your
arrival!"</p>
<p>"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir
William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great
really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not
uncommon."</p>
<p>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning
but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing
them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so
many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower
them.</p>
<p>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
Elizabeth—</p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your
apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of
dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise
you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the
rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will
not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to
have the distinction of rank preserved."</p>
<p>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their
different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine
very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such
formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living,
quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company,
and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much
apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St.
James's.</p>
<p>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half
a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its
prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she
could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to
inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the
windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing
altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</p>
<p>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was
every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look
perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard
nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any
extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere
stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without
trepidation.</p>
<p>From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where
Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her
ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as
Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of
introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner,
without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have
thought necessary.</p>
<p>In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so
completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but
just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat
without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of
her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to
look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could
observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was
a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might
once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her
manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their
inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but
whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked
her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether,
she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.</p>
<p>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and
deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned
her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's
astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither
in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh
was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were
insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to
Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable,
and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and
placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.</p>
<p>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the
windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out
its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was
much better worth looking at in the summer.</p>
<p>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the
servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had
promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the
bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he
felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate,
and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended,
first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered
to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth
wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed
gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious
smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to
them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was
ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged
in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to
her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in
watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some
other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking
out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and
admire.</p>
<p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little
to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without
any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on
every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not
used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into
Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a
great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how
everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and
instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's
attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to
others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she
addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but
especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least,
and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty
kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether
any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome,
where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and
what had been her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the
impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly.
Lady Catherine then observed,</p>
<p>"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For
your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I
see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was
not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play
and sing, Miss Bennet?"</p>
<p>"A little."</p>
<p>"Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"</p>
<p>"One of them does."</p>
<p>"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The
Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
yours. Do you draw?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all."</p>
<p>"What, none of you?"</p>
<p>"Not one."</p>
<p>"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity.
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the
benefit of masters."</p>
<p>"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates
London."</p>
<p>"Has your governess left you?"</p>
<p>"We never had any governess."</p>
<p>"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up
at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your
mother must have been quite a slave to your education."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had
not been the case.</p>
<p>"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,
you must have been neglected."</p>
<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us
as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always
encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."</p>
<p>"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and
if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most
strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done
in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but
a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have
been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a
young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are
most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the
other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely
accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted
with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling
yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of
your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, all."</p>
<p>"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the
second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!
Your younger sisters must be very young?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.
Perhaps&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;is full young to be much in company.
But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger
sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination
to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures
of youth at the first. And to be kept back on<em>such</em>&#160;a
motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly
affection or delicacy of mind."</p>
<p>"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"</p>
<p>"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth,
smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."</p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct
answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature
who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified
impertinence.</p>
<p>"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need
not conceal your age."</p>
<p>"I am not one-and-twenty."</p>
<p>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the
card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and
Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to
play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.
Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively
stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the
game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de
Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too
little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady
Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three
others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was
employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too
many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with
anecdotes and noble names.</p>
<p>When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they
chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.
Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party
then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what
weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions
they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many
speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on
Sir William's they departed. As soon as they had driven from the
door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of
all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she
made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation,
though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr.
Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise
into his own hands.</p>
