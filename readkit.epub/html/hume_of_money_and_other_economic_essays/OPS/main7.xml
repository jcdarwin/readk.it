<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">H</span>AVING endeavoured
to remove one species of ill-founded jealousy, which is so
prevalent among commercial nations, it may not be amiss to mention
another, which seems equally groundless. Nothing is more usual,
among states which have made some advances in commerce, than to
look on the progress of their neighbours with a suspicious eye, to
consider all trading states as their rivals, and to suppose that it
is impossible for any of them to flourish, but at their expence. In
opposition to this narrow and malignant opinion, I will venture to
assert, that the encrease of riches and commerce in any one nation,
instead of hurting, commonly promotes the riches and commerce of
all its neighbours; and that a state can scarcely carry its trade
and industry very far, where all the surrounding states are buried
in ignorance, sloth, and barbarism.</p>
<p>It is obvious, that the domestic industry of a people cannot be
hurt by the greatest prosperity of their neighbours; and as this
branch of commerce is undoubtedly the most important in any
extensive kingdom, we are so far removed from all reason of
jealousy. But I go farther, and observe, that where an open
communication is preserved among nations, it is impossible but the
domestic industry of every one must receive an encrease from the
improvements of the others. Compare the situation of Great Britain
at present, with what it was two centuries ago. All the arts both
of agriculture and manufactures were then extremely rude and
imperfect. Every improvement, which we have since made, has arisen
from our imitation of foreigners; and we ought so far to esteem it
happy, that they had previously made advances in arts and
ingenuity. But this intercourse is still upheld to our great
advantage: Notwithstanding the advanced state of our manufactures,
we daily adopt, in every art, the inventions and improvements of
our neighbours. The commodity is first imported from abroad, to our
great discontent, while we imagine that it drains us of our money:
Afterwards, the art itself is gradually imported, to our visible
advantage: Yet we continue still to repine, that our neighbours
should possess any art, industry, and invention; forgetting that,
had they not first instructed us, we should have been at present
barbarians; and did they not still continue their instructions, the
arts must fall into a state of languor, and lose that emulation and
novelty, which contribute so much to their advancement.</p>
<p>The encrease of domestic industry lays the foundation of foreign
commerce. Where a great number of commodities are raised and
perfected for the home-market, there will always be found some
which can be exported with advantage. But if our neighbours have no
art or cultivation, they cannot take them; because they will have
nothing to give in exchange. In this respect, states are in the
same condition as individuals. A single man can scarcely be
industrious, where all his fellow-citizens are idle. The riches of
the several members of a community contribute to encrease my
riches, whatever profession I may follow. They consume the produce
of my industry, and afford me the produce of theirs in return.</p>
<p>Nor needs any state entertain apprehensions, that their
neighbours will improve to such a degree in every art and
manufacture, as to have no demand from them. Nature, by giving a
diversity of geniuses, climates, and soils, to different nations,
has secured their mutual intercourse and commerce, as long as they
all remain industrious and civilized. Nay, the more the arts
encrease in any state, the more will be its demands from its
industrious neighbours. The inhabitants, having become opulent and
skilful, desire to have every commodity in the utmost perfection;
and as they have plenty of commodities to give in exchange, they
make large importations from every foreign country. The industry of
the nations, from whom they import, receives encouragement: Their
own is also encreased, by the sale of the commodities which they
give in exchange.</p>
<p>But what if a nation has any staple commodity, such as the
woollen manufacture is in England? Must not the interfering of our
neighbours in that manufacture be a loss to us? I answer, that,
when any commodity is denominated the staple of a kingdom, it is
supposed that this kingdom has some peculiar and natural advantages
for raising the commodity; and if, notwithstanding these
advantages, they lose such a manufacture, they ought to blame their
own idleness, or bad government, not the industry of their
neighbours. It ought also to be considered, that, by the encrease
of industry among the neighbouring nations, the consumption of
every particular species of commodity is also encreased; and though
foreign manufactures interfere with them in the market, the demand
for their product may still continue, or even encrease. And should
it diminish, ought the consequence to be esteemed so fatal? If the
spirit of industry be preserved, it may easily be diverted from one
branch to another; and the manufacturers of wool, for instance, be
employed in linen, silk, iron, or any other commodities, for which
there appears to be a demand. We need not apprehend, that all the
objects of industry will be exhausted, or that our manufacturers,
while they remain on an equal footing with those of our neighbours,
will be in danger of wanting employment. The emulation among rival
nations serves rather to keep industry alive in all of them: And
any people is happier who possess a variety of manufactures, than
if they enjoyed one single great manufacture, in which they are all
employed. Their situation is less precarious; and they will feel
less sensibly those revolutions and uncertainties, to which every
particular branch of commerce will always be exposed.</p>
<p>The only commercial state, that ought to dread the improvements
and industry of their neighbours, is such a one as the Dutch, who
enjoying no extent of land, nor possessing any number of native
commodities, flourish only by their being the brokers, and factors,
and carriers of others. Such a people may naturally apprehend,
that, as soon as the neighbouring states come to know and pursue
their interest, they will take into their own hands the management
of their affairs, and deprive their brokers of that profit, which
they formerly reaped from it. But though this consequence may
naturally be dreaded, it is very long before it takes place; and by
art and industry it may be warded off for many generations, if not
wholly eluded. The advantage of superior stocks and correspondence
is so great, that it is not easily overcome; and as all the
transactions encrease by the encrease of industry in the
neighbouring states, even a people whose commerce stands on this
precarious basis, may at first reap a considerable profit from the
flourishing condition of their neighbours. The Dutch, having
mortgaged all their revenues, make not such a figure in political
transactions as formerly; but their commerce is surely equal to
what it was in the middle of the last century, when they were
reckoned among the great powers of Europe.</p>
<p>Were our narrow and malignant politics to meet with success, we
should reduce all our neighbouring nations to the same state of
sloth and ignorance that prevails in Morocco and the coast of
Barbary. But what would be the consequence? They could send us no
commodities: They could take none from us: Our domestic commerce
itself would languish for want of emulation, example, and
instruction: And we ourselves should soon fall into the same abject
condition, to which we had reduced them. I shall therefore venture
to acknowledge, that, not only as a man, but as a British subject,
I pray for the flourishing commerce of Germany, Spain, Italy, and
even France itself. I am at least certain, that Great Britain, and
all those nations, would flourish more, did their sovereigns and
ministers adopt such enlarged and benevolent sentiments towards
each other.</p>
