<div class="text">
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne morning, about
a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he
and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by
the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four
driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors,
and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their
neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the
livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it
was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly
prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an
intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set
off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though
with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their
visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</p>
<p>They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.</p>
<p>She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,
made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight
inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's
entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest
of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to
Elizabeth,</p>
<p>"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother."</p>
<p>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.</p>
<p>"And&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;I suppose is one of your
sisters."</p>
<p>"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady
Catherine. "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is
lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,
walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of
the family."</p>
<p>"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after
a short silence.</p>
<p>"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;
but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."</p>
<p>"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,
in summer; the windows are full west."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,
and then added:</p>
<p>"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left
Mr. and Mrs. Collins well."</p>
<p>"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."</p>
<p>Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her
from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her
calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely
puzzled.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take
some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very
politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to
Elizabeth,</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little
wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a
turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."</p>
<p>"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about
the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the
hermitage."</p>
<p>Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent looking rooms, walked on.</p>
<p>Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel
walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no
effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually
insolent and disagreeable.</p>
<p>"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she
looked in her face.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the
following manner:—</p>
<p>"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of
my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell
you why I come."</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.</p>
<p>"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to
account for the honour of seeing you here."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you
ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however
insincere<em>you</em>&#160;may choose to be, you shall not
find&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a
most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not
only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously
married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all
likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew,
Mr. Darcy. Though I&#160;<em>know</em>&#160;it must be a scandalous
falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the
truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this
place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."</p>
<p>"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth,
colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the
trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by
it?"</p>
<p>"At once to insist upon having such a report universally
contradicted."</p>
<p>"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said
Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed,
such a report is in existence."</p>
<p>"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"</p>
<p>"I never heard that it was."</p>
<p>"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for
it?"</p>
<p>"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."</p>
<p>"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being
satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of
marriage?"</p>
<p>"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."</p>
<p>"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of
his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of
infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to
all his family. You may have drawn him in."</p>
<p>"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed
to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has
in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest
concerns."</p>
<p>"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour
as this, ever induce me to be explicit."</p>
<p>"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy
is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"</p>
<p>"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose
he will make an offer to me."</p>
<p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:</p>
<p>"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their
infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the
favourite wish of&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;mother, as well as of
hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the
moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in
their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,
of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit
engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If
there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall
certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt
wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you
could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others.
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his
cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that
choice, why may not I accept him?"</p>
<p>"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his
family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of
all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone
connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name
will never even be mentioned by any of us."</p>
<p>"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife
of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness
necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the
whole, have no cause to repine."</p>
<p>"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your
gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to
me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss
Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying
my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used
to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of
brooking disappointment."</p>
<p>"<em>That</em>&#160;will make your ladyship's situation at
present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."</p>
<p>"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and
my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the
maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from
respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families.
Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each
other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and
what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman
without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But
it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good,
you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been
brought up."</p>
<p>"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as
quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's
daughter; so far we are equal."</p>
<p>"True. You&#160;<em>are</em>&#160;a gentleman's daughter. But
who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine
me ignorant of their condition."</p>
<p>"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your
nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing
to&#160;<em>you</em>."</p>
<p>"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"</p>
<p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging
Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,
after a moment's deliberation:</p>
<p>"I am not."</p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p>
<p>"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an
engagement?"</p>
<p>"I will make no promise of the kind."</p>
<p>"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a
more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a
belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have
given me the assurance I require."</p>
<p>"And I certainly&#160;<em>never</em>&#160;shall give it. I am
not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your
ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my
giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more
probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to
accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me
to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as
the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as
these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in
his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to
concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned
no farther on the subject."</p>
<p>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all
the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I
am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's
infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying
her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and
uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her
husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his
brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades
of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"</p>
<p>"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully
answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must
beg to return to the house."</p>
<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they
turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.</p>
<p>"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my
nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a
connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of
everybody?"</p>
<p>"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my
sentiments."</p>
<p>"You are then resolved to have him?"</p>
<p>"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that
manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,
without reference to&#160;<em>you</em>, or to any person so wholly
unconnected with me."</p>
<p>"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey
the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to
ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the
contempt of the world."</p>
<p>"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth,
"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No
principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.
Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the
indignation of the world, if the
former&#160;<em>were</em>&#160;excited by his marrying me, it would
not give me one moment's concern—and the world in general would
have too much sense to join in the scorn."</p>
<p>"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very
well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,
that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I
hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my
point."</p>
<p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the
door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, "I
take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously
displeased."</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her
mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask
why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</p>
<p>"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."</p>
<p>"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was
prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the
Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and
so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for
to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was
impossible.</p>
