The Right Whale’s Head — Contrasted View</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the the
Right Whale’s head.</p>
<p>As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared
to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a
rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two
hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of
a shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman
of the nursery tale with the swarming brood, might very comfortably
be lodged, she and all her progeny.</p>
<p>But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume
different aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on
its summit and look at these two f-shaped spout-holes, you would
take the whole head for an enormous bass viol, and these spiracles,
the apertures in its soundingboard. Then, again, if you fix your
eye upon this strange, crested, comblike incrustation on the top of
the mass—this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call
the “crown,” and the Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right
Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for
the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At
any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this
bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,
indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown”
also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest
in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of
the sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this
marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky
looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip!
what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter’s
measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and
pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.</p>
<p>A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be
hare-lipped. The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the
mother during an important interval was sailing down the Peruvian
coast, when earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as
over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my
word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an
Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The
roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle,
as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed,
arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half vertical,
scimitar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side,
which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form
those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily
mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,
through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose
intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes
through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of
bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain
curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen
calculate the creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular
rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from
demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At
any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the
Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable.</p>
<p>In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious
fancies concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them
the wondrous “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_15" id=
"footnote_15_call">[15]</a>&#160;another, “hogs’ bristles”; a third
old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
“There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of
his upper chop, which arch over his tongue on each side of his
mouth.”</p>
<p>As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,”
“whiskers,” “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies
their busks and other stiffening contrivances. But in this
particular, the demand has long been on the decline. It was in
Queen Anne’s time that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale
being then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about
gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in
a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under
the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over
the same bone.</p>
<p>But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
standing in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing
all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would
you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and
gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a
rug of the softest Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were,
to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to
tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now
before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler;
that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.</p>
<p>Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
with— that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no
great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender
mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm
Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and
scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two
external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.</p>
<p>Look your last now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they
yet lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea;
the other will not be very long in following.</p>
<p>Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is
the same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the
forehead seem now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of
a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to
death. But mark the other head’s expression. See that amazing lower
lip, pressed by accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to
embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an
enormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I
take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might
have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.</p>
