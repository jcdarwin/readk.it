<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Jane and
Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her
praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.</p>
<p>"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!"</p>
<p>"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man
ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby
complete."</p>
<p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second
time. I did not expect such a compliment."</p>
<p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference
between us. Compliments always take&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;by
surprise, and&#160;<em>me</em>never. What could be more natural
than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were
about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No
thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very
agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person."</p>
<p>"Dear Lizzy!"</p>
<p>"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in
general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good
and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human
being in your life."</p>
<p>"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always
speak what I think."</p>
<p>"I know you do; and it is&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;which makes
the wonder. With&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;good sense, to be so
honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation
of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be
candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of
everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad—belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."</p>
<p>"Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when
you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,
and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a
very charming neighbour in her."</p>
<p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their
behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in
general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of
temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any
attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour
when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves
agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were
in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating
with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled
to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a
respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more
deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's
fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it
likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was
now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was
doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper,
whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at
Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</p>
<p>His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own;
but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley
was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs.
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less
disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr.
Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an
accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look
at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation
and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its
praise, and took it immediately.</p>
<p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in
spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to
Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,
though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,
and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the
strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and
of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was
the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was
clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious,
and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that
respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving
offense.</p>
<p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more
pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been
most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no
stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as
to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom
there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention
or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she
smiled too much.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they
admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,
and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was
therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt
authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</p>
