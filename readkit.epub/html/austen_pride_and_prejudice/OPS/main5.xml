<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ithin a short
walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were
particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his
mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It
had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a
small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with
his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from
that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his
own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely
in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it
did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all
attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and
obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him
courteous.</p>
<p>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about
twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.</p>
<p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk
over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the
assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to
communicate.</p>
<p>"<em>You</em>&#160;began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.
Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.
"<em>You</em>&#160;were Mr. Bingley's first choice."</p>
<p>"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better."</p>
<p>"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.
To be sure that&#160;<em>did</em>&#160;seem as if he admired
her—indeed I rather believe he&#160;<em>did</em>—I heard something
about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;
did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked
our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a
great many pretty women in the room, and&#160;<em>which</em>he
thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last
question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot
be two opinions on that point.'"</p>
<p>"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem
as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."</p>
<p>"<em>My</em>&#160;overhearings were more to the purpose
than&#160;<em>yours</em>, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not
so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be
only just&#160;<em>tolerable</em>."</p>
<p>"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be
quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night
that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his
lips."</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure, ma'am?—is not there a little mistake?" said
Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."</p>
<p>"Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and
he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry
at being spoke to."</p>
<p>"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances.
With&#160;<em>them</em>&#160;he is remarkably agreeable."</p>
<p>"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how
it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say
he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and
had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</p>
<p>"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas,
"but I wish he had danced with Eliza."</p>
<p>"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance
with&#160;<em>him</em>, if I were you."</p>
<p>"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise
you&#160;<em>never</em>&#160;to dance with him."</p>
<p>"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not
offend&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;so much as pride often does, because
there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a
young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should
think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has
a&#160;<em>right</em>&#160;to be proud."</p>
<p>"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily
forgive&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;pride, if he had not
mortified&#160;<em>mine</em>."</p>
<p>"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of
her reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that
I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed;
that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are
very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on
the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and
pride are different things, though the words are often used
synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride
relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would
have others think of us."</p>
<p>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came
with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep
a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."</p>
<p>"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said
Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away
your bottle directly."</p>
<p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare
that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</p>
