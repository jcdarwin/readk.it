<p>It was disappointing not to have brought back in the evening
some important statement, some authentic fact. Women are poorer
than men because—this or that. Perhaps now it would be better to
give up seeking for the truth, and receiving on one's head an
avalanche of opinion hot as lava, discoloured as dish-water. It
would be better to draw the curtains; to shut out distractions; to
light the lamp; to narrow the enquiry and to ask the historian, who
records not opinions but facts, to describe under what conditions
women lived, not throughout the ages, but in England, say, in the
time of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>For it is a perennial puzzle why no woman wrote a word of that
extraordinary literature when every other man, it seemed, was
capable of song or sonnet. What were the conditions in which women
lived? I asked myself; for fiction, imaginative work that is, is
not dropped like a pebble upon the ground, as science may be;
fiction is like a spider's web, attached ever so lightly perhaps,
but still attached to life at all four corners. Often the
attachment is scarcely perceptible; Shakespeare's plays, for
instance, seem to hang there complete by themselves. But when the
web is pulled askew, hooked up at the edge, torn in the middle, one
remembers that these webs are not spun in mid-air by incorporeal
creatures, but are the work of suffering human beings, and are
attached to grossly material things, like health and money and the
houses we live in.</p>
<p>I went, therefore, to the shelf where the histories stand and
took down one of the latest, Professor Trevelyan's HISTORY OF
ENGLAND. Once more I looked up Women, found 'position of' and
turned to the pages indicated. 'Wife-beating', I read, 'was a
recognized right of man, and was practised without shame by high as
well as low… Similarly,' the historian goes on, 'the daughter who
refused to marry the gentleman of her parents' choice was liable to
be locked up, beaten and flung about the room, without any shock
being inflicted on public opinion. Marriage was not an affair of
personal affection, but of family avarice, particularly in the
"chivalrous" upper classes… Betrothal often took place while one or
both of the parties was in the cradle, and marriage when they were
scarcely out of the nurses' charge.' That was about 1470, soon
after Chaucer's time. The next reference to the position of women
is some two hundred years later, in the time of the Stuarts. 'It
was still the exception for women of the upper and middle class to
choose their own husbands, and when the husband had been assigned,
he was lord and master, so far at least as law and custom could
make him. Yet even so,' Professor Trevelyan concludes, 'neither
Shakespeare's women nor those of authentic seventeenth-century
memoirs, like the Verneys and the Hutchinsons, seem wanting in
personality and character.' Certainly, if we consider it, Cleopatra
must have had a way with her; Lady Macbeth, one would suppose, had
a will of her own; Rosalind, one might conclude, was an attractive
girl. Professor Trevelyan is speaking no more than the truth when
he remarks that Shakespeare's women do not seem wanting in
personality and character. Not being a historian, one might go even
further and say that women have burnt like beacons in all the works
of all the poets from the beginning of time—Clytemnestra, Antigone,
Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Phedre, Cressida, Rosalind, Desdemona, the
Duchess of Malfi, among the dramatists; then among the prose
writers: Millamant, Clarissa, Becky Sharp, Anna Karenina, Emma
Bovary, Madame de Guermantes—the names flock to mind, nor do they
recall women 'lacking in personality and character.' Indeed, if
woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one
would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; very various;
heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; infinitely beautiful and
hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some think even
greater<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_4" id=
"footnote_4_call">[4]</a>. But this is woman in fiction. In fact,
as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, beaten and
flung about the room.</p>
<p>A very queer, composite being thus emerges. Imaginatively she is
of the highest importance; practically she is completely
insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all
but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and
conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose
parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired
words, some of the most profound thoughts in literature fall from
her lips; in real life she could hardly read, could scarcely spell,
and was the property of her husband.</p>
<p>It was certainly an odd monster that one made up by reading the
historians first and the poets afterwards—a worm winged like an
eagle; the spirit of life and beauty in a kitchen chopping up suet.
But these monsters, however amusing to the imagination, have no
existence in fact. What one must do to bring her to life was to
think poetically and prosaically at one and the same moment, thus
keeping in touch with fact—that she is Mrs Martin, aged thirty-six,
dressed in blue, wearing a black hat and brown shoes; but not
losing sight of fiction either—that she is a vessel in which all
sorts of spirits and forces are coursing and flashing perpetually.
The moment, however, that one tries this method with the
Elizabethan woman, one branch of illumination fails; one is held up
by the scarcity of facts. One knows nothing detailed, nothing
perfectly true and substantial about her. History scarcely mentions
her. And I turned to Professor Trevelyan again to see what history
meant to him. I found by looking at his chapter headings that it
meant——</p>
<p>'The Manor Court and the Methods of Open-field Agriculture… The
Cistercians and Sheep-farming… The Crusades… The University&#160;…
The House of Commons… The Hundred Years' War… The Wars of the
Roses… The Renaissance Scholars… The Dissolution of the
Monasteries… Agrarian and Religious Strife… The Origin of English
Sea-power… The Armada… ' and so on. Occasionally an individual
woman is mentioned, an Elizabeth, or a Mary; a queen or a great
lady. But by no possible means could middle-class women with
nothing but brains and character at their command have taken part
in any one of the great movements which, brought together,
constitute the historian's view of the past. Nor shall we find her
in collection of anecdotes. Aubrey hardly mentions her. She never
writes her own life and scarcely keeps a diary; there are only a
handful of her letters in existence. She left no plays or poems by
which we can judge her. What one wants, I thought—and why does not
some brilliant student at Newnham or Girton supply it?—is a mass of
information; at what age did she marry; how many children had she
as a rule; what was her house like, had she a room to herself; did
she do the cooking; would she be likely to have a servant? All
these facts lie somewhere, presumably, in parish registers and
account books; the life of the average Elizabethan woman must be
scattered about somewhere, could one collect it and make a book of
it. It would be ambitious beyond my daring, I thought, looking
about the shelves for books that were not there, to suggest to the
students of those famous colleges that they should rewrite history,
though I own that it often seems a little queer as it is, unreal,
lop-sided; but why should they not add a supplement to history,
calling it, of course, by some inconspicuous name so that women
might figure there without impropriety? For one often catches a
glimpse of them in the lives of the great, whisking away into the
back ground, concealing, I sometimes think, a wink, a laugh,
perhaps a tear. And, after all, we have lives enough of Jane
Austen; it scarcely seems necessary to consider again the influence
of the tragedies of Joanna Baillie upon the poetry of Edgar Allan
Poe; as for myself, I should not mind if the homes and haunts of
Mary Russell Mitford were closed to the public for a century at
least. But what I find deplorable, I continued, looking about the
bookshelves again, is that nothing is known about women before the
eighteenth century. I have no model in my mind to turn about this
way and that. Here am I asking why women did not write poetry in
the Elizabethan age, and I am not sure how they were educated;
whether they were taught to write; whether they had sitting-rooms
to themselves; how many women had children before they were
twenty-one; what, in short, they did from eight in the morning till
eight at night. They had no money evidently; according to Professor
Trevelyan they were married whether they liked it or not before
they were out of the nursery, at fifteen or sixteen very likely. It
would have been extremely odd, even upon this showing, had one of
them suddenly written the plays of Shakespeare, I concluded, and I
thought of that old gentleman, who is dead now, but was a bishop, I
think, who declared that it was impossible for any woman, past,
present, or to come, to have the genius of Shakespeare. He wrote to
the papers about it. He also told a lady who applied to him for
information that cats do not as a matter of fact go to heaven,
though they have, he added, souls of a sort. How much thinking
those old gentlemen used to save one! How the borders of ignorance
shrank back at their approach! Cats do not go to heaven. Women
cannot write the plays of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I could not help thinking, as I looked at the
works of Shakespeare on the shelf, that the bishop was right at
least in this; it would have been impossible, completely and
entirely, for any woman to have written the plays of Shakespeare in
the age of Shakespeare. Let me imagine, since facts are so hard to
come by, what would have happened had Shakespeare had a wonderfully
gifted sister, called Judith, let us say. Shakespeare himself went,
very probably,—his mother was an heiress—to the grammar school,
where he may have learnt Latin—Ovid, Virgil and Horace—and the
elements of grammar and logic. He was, it is well known, a wild boy
who poached rabbits, perhaps shot a deer, and had, rather sooner
than he should have done, to marry a woman in the neighbourhood,
who bore him a child rather quicker than was right. That escapade
sent him to seek his fortune in London. He had, it seemed, a taste
for the theatre; he began by holding horses at the stage door. Very
soon he got work in the theatre, became a successful actor, and
lived at the hub of the universe, meeting everybody, knowing
everybody, practising his art on the boards, exercising his wits in
the streets, and even getting access to the palace of the queen.
Meanwhile his extraordinarily gifted sister, let us suppose,
remained at home. She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog
to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school. She had
no chance of learning grammar and logic, let alone of reading
Horace and Virgil. She picked up a book now and then, one of her
brother's perhaps, and read a few pages. But then her parents came
in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew and not moon
about with books and papers. They would have spoken sharply but
kindly, for they were substantial people who knew the conditions of
life for a woman and loved their daughter—indeed, more likely than
not she was the apple of her father's eye. Perhaps she scribbled
some pages up in an apple loft on the sly but was careful to hide
them or set fire to them. Soon, however, before she was out of her
teens, she was to be betrothed to the son of a neighbouring
wool-stapler. She cried out that marriage was hateful to her, and
for that she was severely beaten by her father. Then he ceased to
scold her. He begged her instead not to hurt him, not to shame him
in this matter of her marriage. He would give her a chain of beads
or a fine petticoat, he said; and there were tears in his eyes. How
could she disobey him? How could she break his heart? The force of
her own gift alone drove her to it. She made up a small parcel of
her belongings, let herself down by a rope one summer's night and
took the road to London. She was not seventeen. The birds that sang
in the hedge were not more musical than she was. She had the
quickest fancy, a gift like her brother's, for the tune of words.
Like him, she had a taste for the theatre. She stood at the stage
door; she wanted to act, she said. Men laughed in her face. The
manager—a fat, looselipped man—guffawed. He bellowed something
about poodles dancing and women acting—no woman, he said, could
possibly be an actress. He hinted—you can imagine what. She could
get no training in her craft. Could she even seek her dinner in a
tavern or roam the streets at midnight? Yet her genius was for
fiction and lusted to feed abundantly upon the lives of men and
women and the study of their ways. At last—for she was very young,
oddly like Shakespeare the poet in her face, with the same grey
eyes and rounded brows—at last Nick Greene the actor-manager took
pity on her; she found herself with child by that gentleman and
so—who shall measure the heat and violence of the poet's heart when
caught and tangled in a woman's body?—killed herself one winter's
night and lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now
stop outside the Elephant and Castle.</p>
<p>That, more or less, is how the story would run, I think, if a
woman in Shakespeare's day had had Shakespeare's genius. But for my
part, I agree with the deceased bishop, if such he was—it is
unthinkable that any woman in Shakespeare's day should have had
Shakespeare's genius. For genius like Shakespeare's is not born
among labouring, uneducated, servile people. It was not born in
England among the Saxons and the Britons. It is not born to-day
among the working classes. How, then, could it have been born among
women whose work began, according to Professor Trevelyan, almost
before they were out of the nursery, who were forced to it by their
parents and held to it by all the power of law and custom? Yet
genius of a sort must have existed among women as it must have
existed among the working classes. Now and again an Emily Brontë or
a Robert Burns blazes out and proves its presence. But certainly it
never got itself on to paper. When, however, one reads of a witch
being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman
selling herbs, or even of a very remarkable man who had a mother,
then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed
poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen, some Emily Brontë
who dashed her brains out on the moor or mopped and mowed about the
highways crazed with the torture that her gift had put her to.
Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems
without singing them, was often a woman. It was a woman Edward
Fitzgerald, I think, suggested who made the ballads and the
folk-songs, crooning them to her children, beguiling her spinning
with them, or the length of the winter's night.</p>
<p>This may be true or it may be false—who can say?—but what is
true in it, so it seemed to me, reviewing the story of
Shakespeare's sister as I had made it, is that any woman born with
a great gift in the sixteenth century would certainly have gone
crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage
outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at.
For it needs little skill in psychology to be sure that a highly
gifted girl who had tried to use her gift for poetry would have
been so thwarted and hindered by other people, so tortured and
pulled asunder by her own contrary instincts, that she must have
lost her health and sanity to a certainty. No girl could have
walked to London and stood at a stage door and forced her way into
the presence of actor-managers without doing herself a violence and
suffering an anguish which may have been irrational—for chastity
may be a fetish invented by certain societies for unknown
reasons—but were none the less inevitable. Chastity had then, it
has even now, a religious importance in a woman's life, and has so
wrapped itself round with nerves and instincts that to cut it free
and bring it to the light of day demands courage of the rarest. To
have lived a free life in London in the six teenth century would
have meant for a woman who was poet and playwright a nervous stress
and dilemma which might well have killed her. Had she survived,
whatever she had written would have been twisted and deformed,
issuing from a strained and morbid imagination. And undoubtedly, I
thought, looking at the shelf where there are no plays by women,
her work would have gone unsigned. That refuge she would have
sought certainly. It was the relic of the sense of chastity that
dictated anonymity to women even so late as the nineteenth century.
Currer Bell, George Eliot, George Sand, all the victims of inner
strife as their writings prove, sought ineffectively to veil
themselves by using the name of a man. Thus they did homage to the
convention, which if not implanted by the other sex was liberally
encouraged by them (the chief glory of a woman is not to be talked
of, said Pericles, himself a much-talked-of man) that publicity in
women is detestable. Anonymity runs in their blood. The desire to
be veiled still possesses them. They are not even now as concerned
about the health of their fame as men are, and, speaking generally,
will pass a tombstone or a signpost without feeling an irresistible
desire to cut their names on it, as Alf, Bert or Chas. must do in
obedience to their instinct, which murmurs if it sees a fine woman
go by, or even a dog, Ce chien est a moi. And, of course, it may
not be a dog, I thought, remembering Parliament Square, the Sieges
Allee and other avenues; it may be a piece of land or a man with
curly black hair. It is one of the great advantages of being a
woman that one can pass even a very fine negress without wishing to
make an Englishwoman of her.</p>
<p>That woman, then, who was born with a gift of poetry in the
sixteenth century, was an unhappy woman, a woman at strife against
herself. All the conditions of her life, all her own instincts,
were hostile to the state of mind which is needed to set free
whatever is in the brain. But what is the state of mind that is
most propitious to the act of creation? I asked. Can one come by
any notion of the state that furthers and makes possible that
strange activity? Here I opened the volume containing the Tragedies
of Shakespeare. What was Shakespeare's state of mind, for instance,
when he wrote LEAR and ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA? It was certainly the
state of mind most favourable to poetry that there has ever
existed. But Shakespeare himself said nothing about it. We only
know casually and by chance that he 'never blotted a line'. Nothing
indeed was ever said by the artist himself about his state of mind
until the eighteenth century perhaps. Rousseau perhaps began it. At
any rate, by the nineteenth century self-consciousness had
developed so far that it was the habit for men of letters to
describe their minds in confessions and autobiographies. Their
lives also were written, and their letters were printed after their
deaths. Thus, though we do not know what Shakespeare went through
when he wrote LEAR, we do know what Carlyle went through when he
wrote the FRENCH REVOLUTION; what Flaubert went through when he
wrote MADAME BOVARY; what Keats was going through when he tried to
write poetry against the coming death and the indifference of the
world.</p>
<p>And one gathers from this enormous modern literature of
confession and self-analysis that to write a work of genius is
almost always a feat of prodigious difficulty. Everything is
against the likelihood that it will come from the writer's mind
whole and entire. Generally material circumstances are against it.
Dogs will bark; people will interrupt; money must be made; health
will break down. Further, accentuating all these difficulties and
making them harder to bear is the world's notorious indifference.
It does not ask people to write poems and novels and histories; it
does not need them. It does not care whether Flaubert finds the
right word or whether Carlyle scrupulously verifies this or that
fact. Naturally, it will not pay for what it does not want. And so
the writer, Keats, Flaubert, Carlyle, suffers, especially in the
creative years of youth, every form of distraction and
discouragement. A curse, a cry of agony, rises from those books of
analysis and confession. 'Mighty poets in their misery dead'—that
is the burden of their song. If anything comes through in spite of
all this, it is a miracle, and probably no book is born entire and
uncrippled as it was conceived.</p>
<p>But for women, I thought, looking at the empty shelves, these
difficulties were infinitely more formidable. In the first place,
to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof
room, was out of the question, unless her parents were
exceptionally rich or very noble, even up to the beginning of the
nineteenth century. Since her pin money, which depended on the
goodwill of her father, was only enough to keep her clothed, she
was debarred from such alleviations as came even to Keats or
Tennyson or Carlyle, all poor men, from a walking tour, a little
journey to France, from the separate lodging which, even if it were
miserable enough, sheltered them from the claims and tyrannies of
their families. Such material difficulties were formidable; but
much worse were the immaterial. The indifference of the world which
Keats and Flaubert and other men of genius have found so hard to
bear was in her case not indifference but hostility. The world did
not say to her as it said to them, Write if you choose; it makes no
difference to me. The world said with a guffaw, Write? What's the
good of your writing? Here the psychologists of Newnham and Girton
might come to our help, I thought, looking again at the blank
spaces on the shelves. For surely it is time that the effect of
discouragement upon the mind of the artist should be measured, as I
have seen a dairy company measure the effect of ordinary milk and
Grade A milk upon the body of the rat. They set two rats in cages
side by side, and of the two one was furtive, timid and small, and
the other was glossy, bold and big. Now what food do we feed women
as artists upon? I asked, remembering, I suppose, that dinner of
prunes and custard. To answer that question I had only to open the
evening paper and to read that Lord Birkenhead is of opinion—but
really I am not going to trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead's
opinion upon the writing of women. What Dean Inge says I will leave
in peace. The Harley Street specialist may be allowed to rouse the
echoes of Harley Street with his vociferations without raising a
hair on my head. I will quote, however, Mr Oscar Browning, because
Mr Oscar Browning was a great figure in Cambridge at one time, and
used to examine the students at Girton and Newnham. Mr Oscar
Browning was wont to declare 'that the impression left on his mind,
after looking over any set of examination papers, was that,
irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was
intellectually the inferior of the worst man'. After saying that Mr
Browning went back to his rooms—and it is this sequel that endears
him and makes him a human figure of some bulk and majesty—he went
back to his rooms and found a stable-boy lying on the sofa—'a mere
skeleton, his cheeks were cavernous and sallow, his teeth were
black, and he did not appear to have the full use of his limbs…
"That's Arthur" [said Mr Browning]. "He's a dear boy really and
most high-minded."' The two pictures always seem to me to complete
each other. And happily in this age of biography the two pictures
often do complete each other, so that we are able to interpret the
opinions of great men not only by what they say, but by what they
do.</p>
<p>But though this is possible now, such opinions coming from the
lips of important people must have been formidable enough even
fifty years ago. Let us suppose that a father from the highest
motives did not wish his daughter to leave home and become writer,
painter or scholar. 'See what Mr Oscar Browning says,' he would
say; and there so was not only Mr Oscar Browning; there was the
SATURDAY REVIEW; there was Mr Greg—the 'essentials of a woman's
being', said Mr Greg emphatically, 'are that THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY,
AND THEY MINISTER TO, MEN'—there was an enormous body of masculine
opinion to the effect that nothing could be expected of women
intellectually. Even if her father did not read out loud these
opinions, any girl could read them for herself; and the reading,
even in the nineteenth century, must have lowered her vitality, and
told profoundly upon her work. There would always have been that
assertion—you cannot do this, you are incapable of doing that—to
protest against, to overcome. Probably for a novelist this germ is
no longer of much effect; for there have been women novelists of
merit. But for painters it must still have some sting in it; and
for musicians, I imagine, is even now active and poisonous in the
extreme. The woman composer stands where the actress stood in the
time of Shakespeare. Nick Greene, I thought, remembering the story
I had made about Shakespeare's sister, said that a woman acting put
him in mind of a dog dancing. Johnson repeated the phrase two
hundred years later of women preaching. And here, I said, opening a
book about music, we have the very words used again in this year of
grace, 1928, of women who try to write music. 'Of Mlle. Germaine
Tailleferre one can only repeat Dr Johnson's dictum concerning, a
woman preacher, transposed into terms of music. "Sir, a woman's
composing is like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done
well, but you are surprised to find it done at all."'<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_5" id=
"footnote_5_call">[5]</a> So accurately does history repeat
itself.</p>
<p>Thus, I concluded, shutting Mr Oscar Browning's life and pushing
away the rest, it is fairly evident that even in the nineteenth
century a woman was not encouraged to be an artist. On the
contrary, she was snubbed, slapped, lectured and exhorted. Her mind
must have been strained and her vitality lowered by the need of
opposing this, of disproving that. For here again we come within
range of that very interesting and obscure masculine complex which
has had so much influence upon the woman's movement; that
deep-seated desire, not so much that SHE shall be inferior as that
HE shall be superior, which plants him wherever one looks, not only
in front of the arts, but barring the way to politics too, even
when the risk to himself seems infinitesimal and the suppliant
humble and devoted. Even Lady Bessborough, I remembered, with all
her passion for politics, must humbly bow herself and write to Lord
Granville Leveson-Gower: '… notwithstanding all my violence in
politicks and talking so much on that subject, I perfectly agree
with you that no woman has any business to meddle with that or any
other serious business, farther than giving her opinion (if she is
ask'd).' And so she goes on to spend her enthusiasm where it meets
with no obstacle whatsoever, upon that immensely important subject,
Lord Granville's maiden speech in the House of Commons. The
spectacle is certainly a strange one, I thought. The history of
men's opposition to women's emancipation is more interesting
perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself. An amusing book
might be made of it if some young student at Girton or Newnham
would collect examples and deduce a theory,—but she would need
thick gloves on her hands, and bars to protect her of solid
gold.</p>
<p>But what is amusing now, I recollected, shutting Lady
Bessborough, had to be taken in desperate earnest once. Opinions
that one now pastes in a book labelled cock-a-doodledum and keeps
for reading to select audiences on summer nights once drew tears, I
can assure you. Among your grandmothers and great-grandmothers
there were many that wept their eyes out. Florence Nightingale
shrieked aloud in her agony<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_6" id="footnote_6_call">[6]</a>. Moreover,
it is all very well for you, who have got yourselves to college and
enjoy sitting-rooms—or is it only bed-sitting-rooms?—of your own to
say that genius should disregard such opinions; that genius should
be above caring what is said of it. Unfortunately, it is precisely
the men or women of genius who mind most what is said of them.
Remember Keats. Remember the words he had cut on his tombstone.
Think of Tennyson; think but I need hardly multiply instances of
the undeniable, if very fortunate, fact that it is the nature of
the artist to mind excessively what is said about him. Literature
is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason
the opinions of others.</p>
<p>And this susceptibility of theirs is doubly unfortunate, I
thought, returning again to my original enquiry into what state of
mind is most propitious for creative work, because the mind of an
artist, in order to achieve the prodigious effort of freeing whole
and entire the work that is in him, must be incandescent, like
Shakespeare's mind, I conjectured, looking at the book which lay
open at ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA. There must be no obstacle in it, no
foreign matter unconsumed.</p>
<p>For though we say that we know nothing about Shakespeare's state
of mind, even as we say that, we are saying something about
Shakespeare's state of mind. The reason perhaps why we know so
little of Shakespeare—compared with Donne or Ben Jonson or
Milton—is that his grudges and spites and antipathies are hidden
from us. We are not held up by some 'revelation' which reminds us
of the writer. All desire to protest, to preach, to proclaim an
injury, to pay off a score, to make the world the witness of some
hardship or grievance was fired out of him and consumed. Therefore
his poetry flows from him free and unimpeded. If ever a human being
got his work expressed completely, it was Shakespeare. If ever a
mind was incandescent, unimpeded, I thought, turning again to the
bookcase, it was Shakespeare's mind.</p>
