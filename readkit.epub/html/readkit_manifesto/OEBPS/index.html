                        <h3>What&#8217;s wrong with eBooks?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Well, where to start? Ebooks are a great medium for both publishers and readers, allowing texts to be viewed across a wide range of different screen sizes, and allowing publishers to sell discrete bundles of content to a willing market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, although a number of channels exist through which publishers can sell their eBook content, the capabilities of most vendor eBook reading systems are still below par, forcing publishers to compromise on quality and market reach.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Specific problems that publishers &#8212; and by extension readers &#8212; face include:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>reading systems that aren&#8217;t able to keep up with recent developments in displaying rich and engaging digital content</li>
                            <li>content that looks and performs differently from one vendor reading system to another, due to incompatibilities and different implementations of features</li>
                            <li>reading systems that lock both publishers and readers to a particular vendor and their devices, reducing market reach</li>
                            <li>eBook standards (EPUB2 &amp; EPUB3) that are full of complexity, and difficult to implement in a standard fashion across different vendor reading systems</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>The pace of change</h4>
                        <p>
                            Modern eBook publishing is built on web standards, and these standards are continually evolving. The current versions of the web standards lynchpins &#8212; HTML5 and CSS3 &#8212; are still not complete, and even when they are will represent only milestones on a constantly-evolving road.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            EPUB is a standard based on web technologies, however the investment of resources and effort required to keep reading systems current with the ongoing development of web standards is beyond the means or interests of many vendors, with the result being reading systems that only allow a fraction of the functionality now available in modern browsers.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            With advances in areas such as typography, animation and metadata, web browser development continues apace and is backed by large communities of effort, both privately funded and open sourced. With recent developments such as <a rel="external" href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, the possibilities for technologies such as real-time communication, speech recognition, and gesture-based interaction are opening up, and these offer many opportunities for publishers producing digital content.

                                    Web browsers that support modern web standards make so much possible. With web standards continually emerging and improving, browsers are &#8212; more than ever &#8212; becoming the platform. Much of the design and presentation that is essential to quality eBook production can be acheived today with browsers such as Webkit (Safari and Chrome), Firefox, and Internet Explorer 10+.
                                </p>

                        <h4>Market reach and vendor lock-in</h4>
                        <p>
                            Publishers want to make their content available to a wide audience, while readers want easy access to a wide range of this content. Given that these motives are aligned, it&#8217;s disappointing that many of the available vendor reading systems effectively lock publishers and readers into a single channel. Publishers can develop alternate versions of their content for other channels, and readers can use multiple reading systems and devices to access content provided through different channels, however both would rather have a single version of content that works across the widest possible range of devices.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With most computing devices these days from smartphones and tablets through to desktop computers featuring a web browser, there already exists something resembling a single platform accessible by the largest part of the market. The range of modern web browsers commonly in use (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer 10+, and Opera) is sufficiently narrow for content developers to be able to produce a single version of content that will work well across all of these, and which will therefore be viewable by readers across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although there will always be differences between these browsers, web designers these days have an easier job of producing content that works consistently across the various browsers and devices than do eBook designers trying to produce EPUB content that works consistently as well across the different vendor reading systems.
                        </p>

                        <h4>EPUB3: a complex standard</h4>

                        <p>
                            The EPUB3 standard provides a rich specification for packaging eBook content, but one that is also perhaps overly complex in a number of areas. Reading system vendors are finding it hard to offer full and consistent support for the functionality allowed by EPUB3, such that complex content will appear seamlessly and similarly across the different vendor reading systems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Given that EPUB3 is based on HTML5 and CSS3 and allows the use of scripting technologies, we can turn to the modern web browser as a solution for rendering the content included in an EPUB3 eBook. The missing piece of the puzzle however, is a means of providing structured access and navigation to this content; although it is easy to uncompress an EPUB3 file and open the constituent pages seperately in a web browser, the browser does not inherently know about the navigation and content structure employed by the EPUB3 content, and so is not able to provide seamless reading of the entire publication without some help.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Readk.it: a solution</h3>

                        <p>
                            Using modern web design techniques, coupled with a light-weight browser-based reading framework supporting structured navigation, we can produce eBooks that provide a book-like experience in the web-browser, but which will also fallback to working conventionally in vendor-supplied reading systems.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Importantly, browser-based display of the eBook content <strong>provides for a reading experience which is both richer than can be acheived in vendor reading systems, and is also accessible by a wide audience in a consistent fashion.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This solution relies on the following principles:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The use of modern web design techniques to allow the content to intelligently adapt to the shape of the container, whether this be a browser on a smartphone, tablet or desktop computer, or whether it is a vendor&#8217;s reading system application.</li>
                            <li>Making use of the standards-based support of modern web browsers to provide rich typography, embedded multimedia, and interactivity and animation</li>
                            <li>The use of a reading system <strong>embedded inside the eBook</strong>, and which can be used by the browser to display the content <strong>according to the publisher&#8217;s wishes</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Responsive web design</h4>

                        <p>Responsive web design involves the use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS/Media_queries">CSS media queries</a> to allow content to behave differently based on the size of the browser screen.
                        </p>

                        <p>With CSS media queries having <a href="http://caniuse.com/css-mediaqueries">across-the-board support</a> from all major browsers, as well as from many vendor reading systems, it is possible to design one version of eBook content that will adapt gracefully to the size of the screen on which it is viewed.
