receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth
half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with
him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had
time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her
daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone
with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs.
Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare
time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane,
however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged
behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each
other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of
him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution;
and perhaps he might be doing the same.</p>
<p>They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call
upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a
general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him
alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,
while her courage was high, she immediately said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of
giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be
wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your
unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it,
I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I
feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have
merely my own gratitude to express."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of
surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what
may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not
think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."</p>
<p>"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first
betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of
course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank
you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that
generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and
bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."</p>
<p>"If you&#160;<em>will</em>&#160;thank me," he replied, "let it
be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you
might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall
not attempt to deny. But your&#160;<em>family</em>&#160;owe me
nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only
of&#160;<em>you</em>."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short
pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with
me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me
so at once.&#160;<em>My</em>&#160;affections and wishes are
unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject
for ever."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and
anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and
immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that
her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period
to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and
pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply
produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he
expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a
man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been
able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became
him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told
her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to
him, made his affection every moment more valuable.</p>
<p>They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too
much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other
objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present
good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him
in her return through London, and there relate her journey to
Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with
Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter
which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her
perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must
assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which
she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its
effect had been exactly contrariwise.</p>
<p>"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed
myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be
certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against
me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and
openly."</p>
<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know
enough of my frankness to believe me capable of&#160;<em>that</em>.
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no
scruple in abusing you to all your relations."</p>
<p>"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though
your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It
was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."</p>
<p>"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to
that evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I
hope, improved in civility."</p>
<p>"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of
what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during
the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly
painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget:
'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your
words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have
tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was
reasonable enough to allow their justice."</p>
<p>"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong
an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt
in such a way."</p>
<p>"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every
proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I
shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you
in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."</p>
<p>"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will
not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily
ashamed of it."</p>
<p>Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make
you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to
its contents?"</p>
<p>She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually
all her former prejudices had been removed.</p>
<p>"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it
was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one
part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your
having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions
which might justly make you hate me."</p>
<p>"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it
essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have
both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are
not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."</p>
<p>"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself
perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was
written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."</p>
<p>"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end
so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter.
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received
it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that
every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.
You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its
remembrance gives you pleasure."</p>
<p>"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the
contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is
much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful
recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be
repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,
though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right,
but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good
principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was
spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,
encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care
for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the
rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense
and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and
twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest,
loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson,
hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly
humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed
me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased."</p>
<p>"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you
to be wishing, expecting my addresses."</p>
<p>"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I
assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might
often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me
after&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;evening?"</p>
<p>"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began
to take a proper direction."</p>
<p>"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we
met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"</p>
<p>"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."</p>
<p>"Your surprise could not be greater
than&#160;<em>mine</em>&#160;in being noticed by you. My conscience
told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess
that I did not expect to receive&#160;<em>more</em>&#160;than my
due."</p>
<p>"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every
civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past;
and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion,
by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How
soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but
I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."</p>
<p>He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and
of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally
leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his
resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister
had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and
thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what
such a purpose must comprehend.</p>
<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a
subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.</p>
<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy
to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their
watches, that it was time to be at home.</p>
<p>"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted
with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest
information of it.</p>
<p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon
happen."</p>
<p>"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as
much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had
been pretty much the case.</p>
<p>"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in
his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had
never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I
believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your
sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that
his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their
happiness together."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing
his friend.</p>
<p>"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you
told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information
last spring?"</p>
<p>"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two
visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her
affection."</p>
<p>"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate
conviction to him."</p>
<p>"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,
but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to
confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended
him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been
in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and
purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am
persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your
sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now."</p>
<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most
delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable;
but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to
be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In
anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be
inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they
reached the house. In the hall they parted.</p>
