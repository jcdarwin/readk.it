<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen they were
gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as
possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since
her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was
there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of
present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each,
there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to
characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of
a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone,
had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence
conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had
hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of
what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of
her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his
visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still
greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with
Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.</p>
<p>She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering
that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had
made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he
was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.</p>
<p>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound
of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the
idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before
called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire
particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her
spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter
amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried
manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing
his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered
him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then
getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came
towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:</p>
<p>"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not
be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire
and love you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,
coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient
encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long
felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were
feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not
more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense
of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family
obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on
with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding,
but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.</p>
<p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be
insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though
her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry
for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his
subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried,
however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he
should have done. He concluded with representing to her the
strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours,
he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope
that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he
said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a
favourable answer. He&#160;<em>spoke</em>&#160;of apprehension and
anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a
circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased,
the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:</p>
<p>"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode
to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation
should be felt, and if I could&#160;<em>feel</em>&#160;gratitude, I
would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good
opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am
sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most
unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes
fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less
resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,
and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He
was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open
his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause
was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of
forced calmness, he said:</p>
<p>"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of
expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so
little<em>endeavour</em>&#160;at civility, I am thus rejected. But
it is of small importance."</p>
<p>"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a
desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you
liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against
your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if
I&#160;<em>was</em>uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know
I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been
indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that
any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the
means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
sister?"</p>
<p>As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the
emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt
her while she continued:</p>
<p>"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive
can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you
acted&#160;<em>there</em>. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you
have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them
from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for
caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the
acutest kind."</p>
<p>She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was
listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any
feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected
incredulity.</p>
<p>"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.</p>
<p>With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of
denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend
from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.
Towards&#160;<em>him</em>&#160;I have been kinder than towards
myself."</p>
<p>Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil
reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to
conciliate her.</p>
<p>"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my
dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of
you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I
received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what
can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you
here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here
impose upon others?"</p>
<p>"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said
Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.</p>
<p>"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling
an interest in him?"</p>
<p>"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed."</p>
<p>"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have
reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty.
You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been
designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of
that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You
have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his
misfortune with contempt and ridicule."</p>
<p>"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across
the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which
you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,
according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"
added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these
offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt
by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my
forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have
been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my
struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled
by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by
everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I
ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she
tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:</p>
<p>"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of
your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared
the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you
behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."</p>
<p>She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she
continued:</p>
<p>"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible
way that would have tempted me to accept it."</p>
<p>Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went
on:</p>
<p>"From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost
say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with
the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your
selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the
groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built
so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I
felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be
prevailed on to marry."</p>
<p>"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my
best wishes for your health and happiness."</p>
<p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth
heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the
house.</p>
<p>The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not
how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried
for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had
passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should
receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have
been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to
wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him
prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at
least with equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It
was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an
affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his shameless avowal
of what he had done with respect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance
in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling
manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards
whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the
consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She
continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.</p>
