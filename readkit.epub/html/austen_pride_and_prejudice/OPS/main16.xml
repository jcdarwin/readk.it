<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s no objection
was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all
Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single
evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton;
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the
drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's
invitation, and was then in the house.</p>
<p>When this information was given, and they had all taken their
seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,
and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the
apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself
in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that
did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips
understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its
proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one of
Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece
alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the
compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the
housekeeper's room.</p>
<p>In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her
mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble
abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily
employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.
Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his
consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to
retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the
girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to
do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent
imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting
appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did
approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt
that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him
since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The
officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party;
but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance,
air, and walk, as&#160;<em>they</em>&#160;were superior to the
broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who
followed them into the room.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female
eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he
finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he
immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being
a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most
threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the
speaker.</p>
<p>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and
the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to
the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at
intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her
watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When
the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her
in turn, by sitting down to whist.</p>
<p>"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be
glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—" Mrs. Phillips
was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his
reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first
there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was
a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of
lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too
eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention
for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the
game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth,
and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly
wished to hear she could not hope to be told—the history of his
acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that
gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr.
Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield
was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a
hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.</p>
<p>"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the
subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in
Derbyshire, I understand."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A
clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person
more capable of giving you certain information on that head than
myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular
manner from my infancy."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.</p>
<p>"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,
after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our
meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"</p>
<p>"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I
have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him
very disagreeable."</p>
<p>"I have no right to give&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;opinion," said
Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not
qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be
a fair judge. It is impossible for&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;to be
impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, I say no more&#160;<em>here</em>&#160;than I
might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He
is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with
his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by
anyone."</p>
<p>"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated
beyond their deserts; but with&#160;<em>him</em>&#160;I believe it
does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and
consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and
sees him only as he chooses to be seen."</p>
<p>"I should take him, even on&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;slight
acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his
head.</p>
<p>"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,
"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."</p>
<p>"I do not at all know; but I&#160;<em>heard</em>&#160;nothing of
his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in
favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the
neighbourhood."</p>
<p>"Oh! no—it is not for&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;to be driven away by
Mr. Darcy. If&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;wishes to avoid
seeing&#160;<em>me</em>, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding&#160;<em>him</em>&#160;but what I might proclaim before
all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful
regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late
Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the
truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this
Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender
recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I
verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather
than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his
father."</p>
<p>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and
listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented
further inquiry.</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.</p>
<p>"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he
added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew
it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny
tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and
the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had
procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a
disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.
I&#160;<em>must</em>&#160;have employment and society. A military
life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now
made it eligible. The church&#160;<em>ought</em>&#160;to have been
my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this
time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it
pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."</p>
<p>"Indeed!"</p>
<p>"Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of
the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively
attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to
provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the
living fell, it was given elsewhere."</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how
could&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;be? How could his will be
disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"</p>
<p>"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest
as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have
doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat
it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had
forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short
anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant
two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it
was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot
accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it.
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my
opinion&#160;<em>of</em>&#160;him, and&#160;<em>to</em>&#160;him,
too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we
are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."</p>
<p>"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly
disgraced."</p>
<p>"Some time or other he&#160;<em>will</em>&#160;be—but it shall
not be by&#160;<em>me</em>. Till I can forget his father, I can
never defy or expose&#160;<em>him</em>."</p>
<p>Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him
handsomer than ever as he expressed them.</p>
<p>"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?
What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"</p>
<p>"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot
but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy
liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his
father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very
early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition
in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given
me."</p>
<p>"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never
liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him
to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not
suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such
injustice, such inhumanity as this."</p>
<p>After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued,
"I&#160;<em>do</em>&#160;remember his boasting one day, at
Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having
an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful."</p>
<p>"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I
can hardly be just to him."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,
"To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of
his father!" She could have added, "A young man, too,
like&#160;<em>you</em>, whose very countenance may vouch for your
being amiable"—but she contented herself with, "and one, too, who
had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,
as I think you said, in the closest manner!"</p>
<p>"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the
greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same
house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental
care.&#160;<em>My</em>&#160;father began life in the profession
which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but
he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and
devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was
most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential
friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the
greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and
when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt
it to be as much a debt of gratitude to&#160;<em>him</em>, as of
his affection to myself."</p>
<p>"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that
the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If
from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be
dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it."</p>
<p>"It&#160;<em>is</em>&#160;wonderful," replied Wickham, "for
almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often
been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than
with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in
his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than
pride."</p>
<p>"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give
his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,
and relieve the poor. Family pride,
and&#160;<em>filial</em>&#160;pride—for he is very proud of what
his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his
family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the
influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has
also&#160;<em>brotherly</em>&#160;pride, which,
with&#160;<em>some</em>&#160;brotherly affection, makes him a very
kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him
generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."</p>
<p>"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me
pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her
brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and
pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and
hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a
handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly
accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been London,
where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."</p>
<p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth
could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:</p>
<p>"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.
Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,
truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit
each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?"</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know
what Mr. Darcy is."</p>
<p>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He
does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he
thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in
consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less
prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is
liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps
agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure."</p>
<p>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players
gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station
between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries
as to his success was made by the latter. It had not been very
great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to
express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest
gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered
the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make
herself uneasy.</p>
<p>"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down
to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and
happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings
any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same,
but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the
necessity of regarding little matters."</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.
Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice
whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family
of de Bourgh.</p>
<p>"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given
him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to
her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."</p>
<p>"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne
Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present
Mr. Darcy."</p>
<p>"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady
Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the
day before yesterday."</p>
<p>"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,
and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two
estates."</p>
<p>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor
Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and
useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if
he were already self-destined for another.</p>
<p>"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine
and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of
her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in
spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited
woman."</p>
<p>"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham;
"I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that
I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and
insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and
clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from
her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the
rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone
connected with him should have an understanding of the first
class."</p>
<p>Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of
it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction
till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies
their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no
conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his
manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said
well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away
with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr.
Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there
was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for
neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked
incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr.
and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard
his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and
repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say
than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn
House.</p>
