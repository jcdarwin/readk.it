engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the
day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth
took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour,"
said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful,
and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther
than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else
than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by
engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and
appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she
would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to
leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the
fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape
out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and
hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious
to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they
saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and
he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might
be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with
reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was
comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house,
and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But
little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence
awaited her there.</p>
<p>In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;
and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name
the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a
solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no
inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which
he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm
that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas,
who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of
an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were
gained.</p>
<p>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their
consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.
Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for
their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his
prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began
directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever
excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to
live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever
Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it
would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make
their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were
properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of&#160;<em>coming out</em>&#160;a year or two sooner than they
might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their
apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself
was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to
consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.
Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his
society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.
But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either
of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable
circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any
other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her;
and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must
be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the
information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he
returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed
before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for
the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very
direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade,
and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he
was longing to publish his prosperous love.</p>
<p>As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see
any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when
the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great
politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him
at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to
visit them.</p>
<p>"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means
wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:</p>
<p>"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation
here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run
the risk of offending your patroness."</p>
<p>"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged
to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not
taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."</p>
<p>"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather
than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by
your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable,
stay quietly at home, and be satisfied
that&#160;<em>we</em>&#160;shall take no offence."</p>
<p>"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily
receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other
mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair
cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it
necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and
happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."</p>
<p>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them
equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet
wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses
to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on
to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the
others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck
her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that
if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as
hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the
following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss
Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with
Elizabeth related the event of the day before.</p>
<p>The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with
her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or
two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far
from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:</p>
<p>"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!"</p>
<p>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling
her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so
direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she
soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:</p>
<p>"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it
incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's
good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with
you?"</p>
<p>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong
effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the
prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that
she wished her all imaginable happiness.</p>
<p>"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be
surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing
to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope
you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you
know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering
Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am
convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most
people can boast on entering the marriage state."</p>
<p>Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward
pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not
stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what
she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all
reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of
Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was
nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always
felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her
own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called
into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to
worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most
humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that
it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.</p>
