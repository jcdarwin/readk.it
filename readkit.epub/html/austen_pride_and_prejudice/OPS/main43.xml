<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ad Elizabeth's
opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have
formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that
appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give,
had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had
very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for
her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all
his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was
not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which
his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which
too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He
was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had
arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little
otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed
to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man
would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of
entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit
from such as are given.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of
her father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with
pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his
affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what
she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that
continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in
exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so
highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the
disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a
marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so
ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found
little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.
Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she
had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of
everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic
circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree
of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other
sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended,
was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a
situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp.
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found
before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient
desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had
promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other
period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have some other
point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again
enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the
Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best
consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the
discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could
she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have
been perfect.</p>
<p>"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to
wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment
would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless
source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to
have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which
every part promises delight can never be successful; and general
disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little
peculiar vexation."</p>
<p>When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very
minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long
expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained
little else than that they were just returned from the library,
where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had
seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had
a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more
fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.
Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from
her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be
learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.</p>
<p>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.
Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town
for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer
engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous
serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered
as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such
happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following
Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an
officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered
in Meryton.</p>
<p>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now
fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a
letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its
commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be
prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in
July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left
too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they
had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort
they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and
substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present
plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their
three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong
attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of
her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably
as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties
of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on
seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time
enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her
temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.</p>
<p>With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of
Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his
county without impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars
without his perceiving me."</p>
<p>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to
pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass
away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at
length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and
eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the
particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general
favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly
adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them,
playing with them, and loving them.</p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off
the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and
amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of
companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to
bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and
affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves
if there were disappointments abroad.</p>
<p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of
Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their
route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,
Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire
is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the
scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately
learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps,
after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and
within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that
Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more
than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the
evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the
place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth
was applied to for her approbation.</p>
<p>"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have
heard so much?" said her aunt; "a place, too, with which so many of
your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth
there, you know."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing
it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after
going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or
satin curtains.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine
house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it
myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the
finest woods in the country."</p>
<p>Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,
instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very
idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt
than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her
private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably
answered.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the
chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was
the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the
family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed
the last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at
leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself;
and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was
again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of
indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To
Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.</p>
