<p>Whatever hour you woke there was a door shunting. From room to
room they went, hand in hand, lifting here, opening there, making
sure—a ghostly couple.</p>
<p>"Here we left it," she said. And he added, "Oh, but here too!"
"It's upstairs," she murmured. "And in the garden," he whispered
"Quietly," they said, "or we shall wake them."</p>
<p>But it wasn't that you woke us. Oh, no. "They're looking for it;
they're drawing the curtain," one might say, and so read on a page
or two. "Now they've found it," one would be certain, stopping the
pencil on the margin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise
and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open,
only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the
threshing machine sounding from the farm. "What did I come in here
for? What did I want to find?" My hands were empty. "Perhaps it's
upstairs then?" The apples were in the loft. And so down again, the
garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass.</p>
<p>But they had found it in the drawing room. Not that one could
ever see them. The window panes reflected apples, reflected roses;
all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the
drawing room, the apple only turned its yellow side. Yet, the
moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the floor, hung
upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling—what? My hands were empty.
The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest wells
of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound. "Safe, safe,
safe," the pulse of the house beat softly. "The treasure buried;
the room… " the pulse stopped short. Oh, was that the buried
treasure?</p>
<p>A moment later the light had faded. Out in the garden then? But
the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. So fine, so
rare, coolly sunk beneath the surface the beam I sought always
burnt behind the glass. Death was the glass; death was between us;
coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the
house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. He left
it, left her, went North, went East, saw the stars turned in the
Southern sky; sought the house, found it dropped beneath the Downs.
"Safe, safe, safe," the pulse of the house beat gladly. "The
Treasure yours."</p>
<p>The wind roars up the avenue. Trees stoop and bend this way and
that. Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam
of the lamp falls straight from the window. The candle burns stiff
and still. Wandering through the house, opening the windows,
whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy.</p>
<p>"Here we slept," she says. And he adds, "Kisses without number."
"Waking in the morning—" "Silver between the trees—" "Upstairs—"
"In the garden—" "When summer came—" "In winter snowtime—" The
doors go shutting far in the distance, gently knocking like the
pulse of a heart.</p>
<p>Nearer they come; cease at the doorway. The wind falls, the rain
slides silver down the glass. Our eyes darken; we hear no steps
beside us; we see no lady spread her ghostly cloak. His hands
shield the lantern. "Look," he breathes. "Sound asleep. Love upon
their lips."</p>
<p>Stooping, holding their silver lamp above us, long they look and
deeply. Long they pause. The wind drives straightly; the flame
stoops slightly. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall,
and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces
that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy.</p>
<p>"Safe, safe, safe," the heart of the house beats proudly. "Long
years—" he sighs. "Again you found me." "Here," she murmurs,
"sleeping; in the garden reading; laughing, rolling apples in the
loft. Here we left our treasure—" Stooping, their light lifts the
lids upon my eyes. "Safe! safe! safe!" the pulse of the house beats
wildly. Waking, I cry "Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light
in the heart."</p>
