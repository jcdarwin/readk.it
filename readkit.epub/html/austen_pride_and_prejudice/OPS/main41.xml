impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer
be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the
scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong
sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear
perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other
feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his
sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but
still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's
refusal must have given him.</p>
<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and
certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must
increase his disappointment!"</p>
<p>"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but
he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his
regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"</p>
<p>"Blame you! Oh, no."</p>
<p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"</p>
<p>"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you
did."</p>
<p>"But you&#160;<em>will</em>&#160;know it, when I tell you what
happened the very next day."</p>
<p>She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its
contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was
this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world
without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race
of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was
Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of
consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to
prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without
involving the other.</p>
<p>"This will not do," said Elizabeth; "you never will be able to
make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must
be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit
between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late
it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined
to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose."</p>
<p>It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from
Jane.</p>
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.
"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy!
Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a
disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!
and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too
distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."</p>
<p>"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing
you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice,
that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much
longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."</p>
<p>"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"</p>
<p>"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education
of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other
all the appearance of it."</p>
<p>"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in
the&#160;<em>appearance</em>&#160;of it as you used to do."</p>
<p>"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a
dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's
genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.
One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but
one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then
stumbling on something witty."</p>
<p>"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not
treat the matter as you do now."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say
unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to
comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and
nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"</p>
<p>"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong
expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now
they<em>do</em>&#160;appear wholly undeserved."</p>
<p>"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a
most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.
There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told
whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general
understand Wickham's character."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can
be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your
opinion?"</p>
<p>"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised
me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every
particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as
possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to
the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice
against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half
the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable
light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and
therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is.
Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at
their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say
nothing about it."</p>
<p>"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin
him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and
anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him
desperate."</p>
<p>The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for
a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,
whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was
still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the
disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's
letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued
by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake;
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding
between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last
encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all
its value!"</p>
<p>She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the
real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still
cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even
fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of
first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater
steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so
fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every
other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of
those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and
their tranquillity.</p>
<p>"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your
opinion&#160;<em>now</em>&#160;of this sad business of Jane's? For
my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I
told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out
that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very
undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there's the least chance
in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know."</p>
<p>"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any
more."</p>
<p>"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.
Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if
I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I
am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry
for what he has done."</p>
<p>But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such
expectation, she made no answer.</p>
<p>"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so
the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only
hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte
is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant
in&#160;<em>their</em>&#160;housekeeping, I dare say."</p>
<p>"No, nothing at all."</p>
<p>"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes,
yes.&#160;<em>they</em>&#160;will take care not to outrun their
income.&#160;<em>They</em>&#160;will never be distressed for money.
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk
of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."</p>
<p>"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."</p>
<p>"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt
they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy
with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on
me."</p>
