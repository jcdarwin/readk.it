<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is very usual,
in nations ignorant of the nature of commerce, to prohibit the
exportation of commodities, and to preserve among themselves
whatever they think valuable and useful. They do not consider,
that, in this prohibition, they act directly contrary to their
intention; and that the more is exported of any commodity, the more
will be raised at home, of which they themselves will always have
the first offer.</p>
<p>It is well known to the learned, that the ancient laws of Athens
rendered the exportation of figs criminal; that being supposed a
species of fruit so excellent in Attica, that the Athenians deemed
it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner. And in this
ridiculous prohibition they were so much in earnest, that informers
were thence called <em>sycophants</em> among them, from two Greek
words, which signify <em>figs</em> and
<em>discoverer</em>.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_17" id="footnote_17_call">[17]</a> There
are proofs in many old acts of parliament of the same ignorance in
the nature of commerce, particularly in the reign of Edward III.
And to this day, in France, the exportation of corn is almost
always prohibited; in order, as they say, to prevent famines;
though it is evident, that nothing contributes more to the frequent
famines, which so much distress that fertile country.</p>
<p>The same jealous fear, with regard to money, has also prevailed
among several nations; and it required both reason and experience
to convince any people, that these prohibitions serve to no other
purpose than to raise the exchange against them, and produce a
still greater exportation.</p>
<p>These errors, one may say, are gross and palpable: But there
still prevails, even in nations well acquainted with commerce, a
strong jealousy with regard to the balance of trade, and a fear,
that all their gold and silver may be leaving them. This seems to
me, almost in every case, a groundless apprehension; and I should
as soon dread, that all our springs and rivers should be exhausted,
as that money should abandon a kingdom where there are people and
industry. Let us carefully preserve these latter advantages; and we
need never be apprehensive of losing the former.</p>
<p>It is easy to observe, that all calculations concerning the
balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and
suppositions. The custom-house books are allowed to be an
insufficient ground of reasoning; nor is the rate of exchange much
better; unless we consider it with all nations, and know also the
proportions of the several sums remitted; which one may safely
pronounce impossible. Every man, who has ever reasoned on this
subject, has always proved his theory, whatever it was, by facts
and calculations, and by an enumeration of all the commodities sent
to all foreign kingdoms.</p>
<p>The writings of Mr. Gee struck the nation with an universal
panic, when they saw it plainly demonstrated, by a detail of
particulars, that the balance was against them for so considerable
a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six
years. But luckily, twenty years have since elapsed, with an
expensive foreign war; yet is it commonly supposed, that money is
still more plentiful among us than in any former period.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more entertaining on this head than Dr. Swift; an
author so quick in discerning the mistakes and absurdities of
others. He says, in his <em>short view of the state of</em>
Ireland, that the whole cash of that kingdom formerly amounted but
to <em>500,000l.</em>; that out of this the Irish remitted every
year a neat million to England, and had scarcely any other source
from which they could compensate themselves, and little other
foreign trade than the importation of French wines, for which they
paid ready money. The consequence of this situation, which must be
owned to be disadvantageous, was, that, in a course of three years,
the current money of Ireland, from 500,000l. was reduced to less
than two. And at present, I suppose, in a course of 30 years it is
absolutely nothing. Yet I know not how, that opinion of the advance
of riches in Ireland, which gave the Doctor so much indignation,
seems still to continue, and gain ground with every body.</p>
<p>In short, this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade,
appears of such a nature, that it discovers itself, wherever one is
out of humour with the ministry, or is in low spirits; and as it
can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports,
which counterbalance the imports, it may here be proper to form a
general argument, that may prove the impossibility of this event,
as long as we preserve our people and our industry.</p>
<p>Suppose four-fifths of all the money in Great Britain to be
annihilated in one night, and the nation reduced to the same
condition, with regard to specie, as in the reigns of the Harrys
and Edwards, what would be the consequence? Must not the price of
all labour and commodities sink in proportion, and every thing be
sold as cheap as they were in those ages? What nation could then
dispute with us in any foreign market, or pretend to navigate or to
sell manufactures at the same price, which to us would afford
sufficient profit? In how little time, therefore, must this bring
back the money which we had lost, and raise us to the level of all
the neighbouring nations? Where, after we have arrived, we
immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and
commodities; and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our
fulness and repletion.</p>
<p>Again, suppose, that all the money of Great Britain were
multiplied fivefold in a night, must not the contrary effect
follow? Must not all labour and commodities rise to such an
exorbitant height, that no neighbouring nations could afford to buy
from us; while their commodities, on the other hand, became
comparatively so cheap, that, in spite of all the laws which could
be formed, they would be run in upon us, and our money flow out;
till we fall to a level with foreigners, and lose that great
superiority of riches, which had laid us under such
disadvantages?</p>
<p>Now, it is evident, that the same causes, which would correct
these exorbitant inequalities, were they to happen miraculously,
must prevent their happening in the common course of nature, and
must for ever, in all neighbouring nations, preserve money nearly
proportionable to the art and industry of each nation. All water,
wherever it communicates, remains always at a level. Ask
naturalists the reason; they tell you, that, were it to be raised
in any one place, the superior gravity of that part not being
balanced, must depress it, till it meet a counterpoise; and that
the same cause, which redresses the inequality when it happens,
must for ever prevent it, without some violent external
operation.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_18" id=
"footnote_18_call">[18]</a></p>
<p>Can one imagine, that it had ever been possible, by any laws, or
even by any art or industry, to have kept all the money in Spain,
which the galleons have brought from the Indies? Or that all
commodities could be sold in France for a tenth of the price which
they would yield on the other side of the Pyrenees, without finding
their way thither, and draining from that immense treasure? What
other reason, indeed, is there, why all nations, at present, gain
in their trade with Spain and Portugal; but because it is
impossible to heap up money, more than any fluid, beyond its proper
level? The sovereigns of these countries have shown, that they
wanted not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves,
had it been in any degree practicable.</p>
<p>But as any body of water may be raised above the level of the
surrounding element, if the former has no communication with the
latter; so in money, if the communication be cut off, by any
material or physical impediment, (for all laws alone are
ineffectual) there may, in such a case, be a very great inequality
of money. Thus the immense distance of China, together with the
monopolies of our India companies, obstructing the communication,
preserve in Europe the gold and silver, especially the latter, in
much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom. But,
notwithstanding this great obstruction, the force of the causes
abovementioned is still evident. The skill and ingenuity of Europe
in general surpasses perhaps that of China, with regard to manual
arts and manufactures; yet are we never able to trade thither
without great disadvantage. And were it not for the continual
recruits, which we receive from America, money would soon sink in
Europe, and rise in China, till it came nearly to a level in both
places. Nor can any reasonable man doubt, but that industrious
nation, were they as near us as Poland or Barbary, would drain us
of the overplus of our specie, and draw to themselves a larger
share of the West Indian treasures. We need not have recourse to a
physical attraction, in order to explain the necessity of this
operation. There is a moral attraction, arising from the interests
and passions of men, which is full as potent and infallible.</p>
<p>How is the balance kept in the provinces of every kingdom among
themselves, but by the force of this principle, which makes it
impossible for money to lose its level, and either to rise or sink
beyond the proportion of the labour and commodities which are in
each province? Did not long experience make people easy on this
head, what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford
to a melancholy Yorkshireman, while he computed and magnified the
sums drawn to London by taxes, absentees, commodities, and found on
comparison the opposite articles so much inferior? And no doubt,
had the <em>Heptarchy</em> subsisted in England, the legislature of
each state had been continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong
balance; and as it is probable that the mutual hatred of these
states would have been extremely violent on account of their close
neighbourhood, they would have loaded and oppressed all commerce,
by a jealous and superfluous caution. Since the union has removed
the barriers between Scotland and England, which of these nations
gains from the other by this free commerce? Or if the former
kingdom has received any encrease of riches, can it reasonably be
accounted for by any thing but the encrease of its art and
industry? It was a common apprehension in England, before the
union, as we learn from L’Abbe du Bos,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_19" id="footnote_19_call">[19]</a> that
Scotland would soon drain them of their treasure, were an open
trade allowed; and on the other side the Tweed a contrary
apprehension prevailed: With what justice in both, time has
shown.</p>
<p>What happens in small portions of mankind, must take place in
greater. The provinces of the Roman empire, no doubt, kept their
balance with each other, and with Italy, independent of the
legislature; as much as the several counties of Great Britain, or
the several parishes of each county. And any man who travels over
Europe at this day, may see, by the prices of commodities, that
money, in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states, has
brought itself nearly to a level; and that the difference between
one kingdom and another is not greater in this respect, than it is
often between different provinces of the same kingdom. Men
naturally flock to capital cities, sea-ports, and navigable rivers.
There we find more men, more industry, more commodities, and
consequently more money; but still the latter difference holds
proportion with the former, and the level is preserved.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_20" id=
"footnote_20_call">[20]</a></p>
<p>Our jealousy and our hatred of France are without bounds; and
the former sentiment, at least, must be acknowledged reasonable and
well-grounded. These passions have occasioned innumerable barriers
and obstructions upon commerce, where we are accused of being
commonly the aggressors. But what have we gained by the bargain? We
lost the French market for our woollen manufactures, and
transferred the commerce of wine to Spain and Portugal, where we
buy worse liquor at a higher price. There are few Englishmen who
would not think their country absolutely ruined, were French wines
sold in England so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant, in
some measure, all ale, and home-brewed liquors: But would we lay
aside prejudice, it would not be difficult to prove, that nothing
could be more innocent, perhaps advantageous. Each new acre of
vineyard planted in France, in order to supply England with wine,
would make it requisite for the French to take the produce of an
English acre, sown in wheat or barley, in order to subsist
themselves; and it is evident, that we should thereby get command
of the better commodity.</p>
<p>There are many edicts of the French king, prohibiting the
planting of new vineyards, and ordering all those which are lately
planted to be grubbed up: So sensible are they, in that country, of
the superior value of corn, above every other product.</p>
<p>Mareschal Vauban complains often, and with reason, of the absurd
duties which load the entry of those wines of Languedoc, Guienne,
and other southern provinces, that are imported into Britanny and
Normandy. He entertained no doubt but these latter provinces could
preserve their balance, notwithstanding the open commerce which he
recommends. And it is evident, that a few leagues more navigation
to England would make no difference; or if it did, that it must
operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms.</p>
<p>There is indeed one expedient by which it is possible to sink,
and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in
any kingdom; but these cases, when examined, will be found to
resolve into our general theory, and to bring additional authority
to it.</p>
<p>I scarcely know any method of sinking money below its level, but
those institutions of banks, funds, and paper-credit, which are so
much practised in this kingdom. These render paper equivalent to
money, circulate it throughout the whole state, make it supply the
place of gold and silver, raise proportionably the price of labour
and commodities, and by that means either banish a great part of
those precious metals, or prevent their farther encrease. What can
be more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head? We fancy,
because an individual would be much richer, were his stock of money
doubled, that the same good effect would follow were the money of
every one encreased; not considering, that this would raise as much
the price of every commodity, and reduce every man, in time, to the
same condition as before. It is only in our public negociations and
transactions with foreigners, that a greater stock of money is
advantageous; and as our paper is there absolutely insignificant,
we feel, by its means, all the ill effects arising from a great
abundance of money, without reaping any of the advantages.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_21" id=
"footnote_21_call">[21]</a></p>
<p>Suppose that there are 12 millions of paper, which circulate in
the kingdom as money, (for we are not to imagine, that all our
enormous funds are employed in that shape) and suppose the real
cash of the kingdom to be 18 millions: Here is a state which is
found by experience to be able to hold a stock of 30 millions. I
say, if it be able to hold it, it must of necessity have acquired
it in gold and silver, had we not obstructed the entrance of these
metals by this new invention of paper. <em>Whence would it have
acquired that sum</em>? From all the kingdoms of the world. <em>But
why</em>? Because, if you remove these 12 millions, money in this
state is below its level, compared with our neighbours; and we must
immediately draw from all of them, till we be full and saturate, so
to speak, and can hold no more. By our present politics, we are as
careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bank-bills
and chequer-notes, as if we were afraid of being overburthened with
the precious metals.</p>
<p>It is not to be doubted, but the great plenty of bullion in
France is, in a great measure, owing to the want of paper-credit.
The French have no banks: Merchants bills do not there circulate as
with us: Usury or lending on interest is not directly permitted; so
that many have large sums in their coffers: Great quantities of
plate are used in private houses; and all the churches are full of
it. By this means, provisions and labour still remain cheaper among
them, than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and silver.
The advantages of this situation, in point of trade as well as in
great public emergencies, are too evident to be disputed.</p>
<p>The same fashion a few years ago prevailed in Genoa, which still
has place in England and Holland, of using services of China-ware
instead of plate; but the senate, foreseeing the consequence,
prohibited the use of that brittle commodity beyond a certain
extent; while the use of silver-plate was left unlimited. And I
suppose, in their late distresses, they felt the good effect of
this ordinance. Our tax on plate is, perhaps, in this view,
somewhat impolitic.</p>
<p>Before the introduction of paper-money into our colonies, they
had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation. Since the
introduction of that commodity, the least inconveniency that has
followed is the total banishment of the precious metals. And after
the abolition of paper, can it be doubted but money will return,
while these colonies possess manufactures and commodities, the only
thing valuable in commerce, and for whose sake alone all men desire
money.</p>
<p>What pity Lycurgus did not think of paper-credit, when he wanted
to banish gold and silver from Sparta! It would have served his
purpose better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money; and
would also have prevented more effectually all commerce with
strangers, as being of so much less real and intrinsic value.</p>
<p>It must, however, be confessed, that, as all these questions of
trade and money are extremely complicated, there are certain
lights, in which this subject may be placed, so as to represent the
advantages of paper-credit and banks to be superior to their
disadvantages. That they banish specie and bullion from a state is
undoubtedly true; and whoever looks no farther than this
circumstance does well to condemn them; but specie and bullion are
not of so great consequence as not to admit of a compensation, and
even an overbalance from the encrease of industry and of credit,
which may be promoted by the right use of paper-money. It is well
known of what advantage it is to a merchant to be able to discount
his bills upon occasion; and every thing that facilitates this
species of traffic is favourable to the general commerce of a
state. But private bankers are enabled to give such credit by the
credit they receive from the depositing of money in their shops;
and the bank of England in the same manner, from the liberty it has
to issue its notes in all payments. There was an invention of this
kind, which was fallen upon some years ago by the banks of
Edinburgh; and which, as it is one of the most ingenious ideas that
has been executed in commerce, has also been thought advantageous
to Scotland. It is there called a Bank-Credit; and is of this
nature. A man goes to the bank and finds surety to the amount, we
shall suppose, of a thousand pounds. This money, or any part of it,
he has the liberty of drawing out whenever he pleases, and he pays
only the ordinary interest for it, while it is in his hands. He
may, when he pleases, repay any sum so small as twenty pounds, and
the interest is discounted from the very day of the repayment. The
advantages, resulting from this contrivance, are manifold. As a man
may find surety nearly to the amount of his substance, and his
bank-credit is equivalent to ready money, a merchant does hereby in
a manner coin his houses, his household furniture, the goods in his
warehouse, the foreign debts due to him, his ships at sea; and can,
upon occasion, employ them in all payments, as if they were the
current money of the country. If a man borrow a thousand pounds
from a private hand, besides that it is not always to be found when
required, he pays interest for it, whether he be using it or not:
His bank-credit costs him nothing except during the very moment, in
which it is of service to him: And this circumstance is of equal
advantage as if he had borrowed money at much lower interest.
Merchants, likewise, from this invention, acquire a great facility
in supporting each other’s credit, which is a considerable security
against bankruptcies. A man, when his own bank-credit is exhausted,
goes to any of his neighbours who is not in the same condition; and
he gets the money, which he replaces at his convenience.</p>
<p>After this practice had taken place during some years at
Edinburgh, several companies of merchants at Glasgow carried the
matter farther. They associated themselves into different banks,
and issued notes so low as ten shillings, which they used in all
payments for goods, manufactures, tradesmen’s labour of all kinds;
and these notes, from the established credit of the companies,
passed as money in all payments throughout the country. By this
means, a stock of five thousand pounds was able to perform the same
operations as if it were six or seven; and merchants were thereby
enabled to trade to a greater extent, and to require less profit in
all their transactions. But whatever other advantages result from
these inventions, it must still be allowed that, besides giving too
great facility to credit, which is dangerous, they banish the
precious metals; and nothing can be a more evident proof of it,
than a comparison of the past and present condition of Scotland in
that particular. It was found, upon the recoinage made after the
union, that there was near a million of specie in that country: But
notwithstanding the great encrease of riches, commerce and
manufactures of all kinds, it is thought, that, even where there is
no extraordinary drain made by England, the current specie will not
now amount to a third of that sum.</p>
<p>But as our projects of paper-credit are almost the only
expedient, by which we can sink money below its level; so, in my
opinion, the only expedient, by which we can raise money above it,
is a practice which we should all exclaim against as destructive,
namely, the gathering of large sums into a public treasure, locking
them up, and absolutely preventing their circulation. The fluid,
not communicating with the neighbouring element, may, by such an
artifice, be raised to what height we please. To prove this, we
need only return to our first supposition, of annihilating the half
or any part of our cash; where we found, that the immediate
consequence of such an event would be the attraction of an equal
sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms. Nor does there seem to be
any necessary bounds set, by the nature of things, to this practice
of hoarding. A small city, like Geneva, continuing this policy for
ages, might engross nine-tenths of the money of Europe. There
seems, indeed, in the nature of man, an invincible obstacle to that
immense growth of riches. A weak state, with an enormous treasure,
will soon become a prey to some of its poorer, but more powerful
neighbours. A great state would dissipate its wealth in dangerous
and ill-concerted projects; and probably destroy, with it, what is
much more valuable, the industry, morals, and numbers of its
people. The fluid, in this case, raised to too great a height,
bursts and destroys the vessel that contains it; and mixing itself
with the surrounding element, soon falls to its proper level.</p>
<p>So little are we commonly acquainted with this principle, that,
though all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an
event, as the immense treasure amassed by Harry VII. (which they
make amount to 2,700,000 pounds,) we rather reject their concurring
testimony, than admit of a fact, which agrees so ill with our
inveterate prejudices. It is indeed probable, that this sum might
be three-fourths of all the money in England. But where is the
difficulty in conceiving, that such a sum might be amassed in
twenty years, by a cunning, rapacious, frugal, and almost absolute
monarch? Nor is it probable, that the diminution of circulating
money was ever sensibly felt by the people, or ever did them any
prejudice. The sinking of the prices of all commodities would
immediately replace it, by giving England the advantage in its
commerce with the neighbouring kingdoms.</p>
<p>Have we not an instance, in the small republic of Athens with
its allies, who, in about fifty years, between the Median and
Peloponnesian wars, amassed a sum not much inferior to that of
Harry VII.? For all the Greek historians<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_22" id="footnote_22_call">[22]</a> and
orators<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_23" id=
"footnote_23_call">[23]</a> agree, that the Athenians collected in
the citadel more than 10,000 talents, which they afterwards
dissipated to their own ruin, in rash and imprudent enterprizes.
But when this money was set a running, and began to communicate
with the surrounding fluid; what was the consequence? Did it remain
in the state? No. For we find, by the memorable <em>census</em>
mentioned by Demosthenes<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_24" id="footnote_24_call">[24]</a> and
Polybius,<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_25" id=
"footnote_25_call">[25]</a> that, in about fifty years afterwards,
the whole value of the republic, comprehending lands, houses,
commodities, slaves, and money, was less than 6000 talents.</p>
<p>What an ambitious high-spirited people was this, to collect and
keep in their treasury, with a view to conquests, a sum, which it
was every day in the power of the citizens, by a single vote, to
distribute among themselves, and which would have gone near to
triple the riches of every individual! For we must observe, that
the numbers and private riches of the Athenians are said, by
ancient writers, to have been no greater at the beginning of the
Peloponnesian war, than at the beginning of the Macedonian.</p>
<p>Money was little more plentiful in Greece during the age of
Philip and Perseus, than in England during that of Harry VII.: Yet
these two monarchs in thirty years<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_26" id="footnote_26_call">[26]</a>
collected from the small kingdom of Macedon, a larger treasure than
that of the English monarch. Paulus AEmilius brought to Rome about
1,700,000 pounds <em>Sterling</em>.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_27" id="footnote_27_call">[27]</a> Pliny
says, 2,400,000.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_28" id="footnote_28_call">[28]</a> And that
was but a part of the Macedonian treasure. The rest was dissipated
by the resistance and flight of Perseus.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_29" id="footnote_29_call">[29]</a></p>
<p>We may learn from Stanian, that the canton of Berne had 300,000
pounds lent at interest, and had above six times as much in their
treasury. Here then is a sum hoarded of 1,800,000 pounds
<em>Sterling</em>, which is at least quadruple what should
naturally circulate in such a petty state; and yet no one, who
travels in the Pais de Vaux, or any part of that canton, observes
any want of money more than could be supposed in a country of that
extent, soil, and situation. On the contrary, there are scarce any
inland provinces in the continent of France or Germany, where the
inhabitants are at this time so opulent, though that canton has
vastly encreased its treasure since 1714, the time when Stanian
wrote his judicious account of Switzerland.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_30" id="footnote_30_call">[30]</a></p>
<p>The account given by Appian<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_31" id="footnote_31_call">[31]</a> of the
treasure of the Ptolemies, is so prodigious, that one cannot admit
of it; and so much the less, because the historian says, that the
other successors of Alexander were also frugal, and had many of
them treasures not much inferior. For this saving humour of the
neighbouring princes must necessarily have checked the frugality of
the Egyptian monarchs, according to the foregoing theory. The sum
he mentions is 740,000 talents, or 191,166,666 pounds 13 shillings
and 4 pence, according to Dr. Arbuthnot’s computation. And yet
Appian says, that he extracted his account from the public records;
and he was himself a native of Alexandria.</p>
<p>From these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to
form of those numberless bars, obstructions, and imposts, which all
nations of Europe, and none more than England, have put upon trade;
from an exorbitant desire of amassing money, which never will heap
up beyond its level, while it circulates; or from an ill-grounded
apprehension of losing their specie, which never will sink below
it. Could any thing scatter our riches, it would be such impolitic
contrivances. But this general ill effect, however, results from
them, that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free
communication and exchange which the Author of the world has
intended, by giving them soils, climates, and geniuses, so
different from each other.</p>
<p>Our modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money,
the using of paper-credit; they reject the only method of amassing
it, the practice of hoarding; and they adopt a hundred
contrivances, which serve to no purpose but to check industry, and
rob ourselves and our neighbours of the common benefits of art and
nature.</p>
<p>All taxes, however, upon foreign commodities, are not to be
regarded as prejudicial or useless, but those only which are
founded on the jealousy above-mentioned. A tax on German linen
encourages home manufactures, and thereby multiplies our people and
industry. A tax on brandy encreases the sale of rum, and supports
our southern colonies. And as it is necessary, that imposts should
be levied, for the support of government, it may be thought more
convenient to lay them on foreign commodities, which can easily be
intercepted at the port, and subjected to the impost. We ought,
however, always to remember the maxim of Dr. Swift, That, in the
arithmetic of the customs, two and two make not four, but often
make only one. It can scarcely be doubted, but if the duties on
wine were lowered to a third, they would yield much more to the
government than at present: Our people might thereby afford to
drink commonly a better and more wholesome liquor; and no prejudice
would ensue to the balance of trade, of which we are so jealous.
The manufacture of ale beyond the agriculture is but
inconsiderable, and gives employment to few hands. The transport of
wine and corn would not be much inferior.</p>
<p>But are there not frequent instances, you will say, of states
and kingdoms, which were formerly rich and opulent, and are now
poor and beggarly? Has not the money left them, with which they
formerly abounded? I answer, If they lose their trade, industry,
and people, they cannot expect to keep their gold and silver: For
these precious metals will hold proportion to the former
advantages. When Lisbon and Amsterdam got the East-India trade from
Venice and Genoa, they also got the profits and money which arose
from it. Where the seat of government is transferred, where
expensive armies are maintained at a distance, where great funds
are possessed by foreigners; there naturally follows from these
causes a diminution of the specie. But these, we may observe, are
violent and forcible methods of carrying away money, and are in
time commonly attended with the transport of people and industry.
But where these remain, and the drain is not continued, the money
always finds its way back again, by a hundred canals, of which we
have no notion or suspicion. What immense treasures have been
spent, by so many nations, in Flanders, since the revolution, in
the course of three long wars? More money perhaps than the half of
what is at present in Europe. But what has now become of it? Is it
in the narrow compass of the Austrian provinces? No, surely: It has
most of it returned to the several countries whence it came, and
has followed that art and industry, by which at first it was
acquired. For above a thousand years, the money of Europe has been
flowing to Rome, by an open and sensible current; but it has been
emptied by many secret and insensible canals: And the want of
industry and commerce renders at present the papal dominions the
poorest territory in all Italy.</p>
<p>In short, a government has great reason to preserve with care
its people and its manufactures. Its money, it may safely trust to
the course of human affairs, without fear or jealousy. Or if it
ever give attention to this latter circumstance, it ought only to
be so far as it affects the former.</p>
