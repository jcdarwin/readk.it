<p>That one would find any woman in that state of mind in the
sixteenth century was obviously impossible. One has only to think
of the Elizabethan tombstones with all those children kneeling with
clasped hands; and their early deaths; and to see their houses with
their dark, cramped rooms, to realize that no woman could have
written poetry then. What one would expect to find would be that
rather later perhaps some great lady would take advantage of her
comparative freedom and comfort to publish something with her name
to it and risk being thought a monster. Men, of course, are not
snobs, I continued, carefully eschewing 'the arrant feminism' of
Miss Rebecca West; but they appreciate with sympathy for the most
part the efforts of a countess to write verse. One would expect to
find a lady of title meeting with far greater encouragement than an
unknown Miss Austen or a Miss Brontë at that time would have met
with. But one would also expect to find that her mind was disturbed
by alien emotions like fear and hatred and that her poems showed
traces of that disturbance. Here is Lady Winchilsea, for example, I
thought, taking down her poems. She was born in the year 1661; she
was noble both by birth and by marriage; she was childless; she
wrote poetry, and one has only to open her poetry to find her
bursting out in indignation against the position of women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How we are fallen! fallen by mistaken rules,<br />
And Education's more than Nature's fools;<br />
Debarred from all improvements of the mind,<br />
And to be dull, expected and designed;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if someone would soar above the rest,<br />
With warmer fancy, and ambition pressed,<br />
So strong the opposing faction still appears,<br />
The hopes to thrive can ne'er outweigh the fears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly her mind has by no means 'consumed all impediments and
become incandescent'. On the contrary, it is harassed and
distracted with hates and grievances. The human race is split up
for her into two parties. Men are the 'opposing faction'; men are
hated and feared, because they have the power to bar her way to
what she wants to do—which is to write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas! a woman that attempts the pen,<br />
Such a presumptuous creature is esteemed,<br />
The fault can by no virtue be redeemed.<br />
They tell us we mistake our sex and way;<br />
Good breeding, fashion, dancing, dressing, play,<br />
Are the accomplishments we should desire;<br />
To write, or read, or think, or to enquire,<br />
Would cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,<br />
And interrupt the conquests of our prime.<br />
Whilst the dull manage of a servile house<br />
Is held by some our utmost art and use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed she has to encourage herself to write by supposing that
what she writes will never be published; to soothe herself with the
sad chant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To some few friends, and to thy sorrows sing,<br />
For groves of laurel thou wert never meant;<br />
Be dark enough thy shades, and be thou there content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it is clear that could she have freed her mind from hate and
fear and not heaped it with bitterness and resentment, the fire was
hot within her. Now and again words issue of pure poetry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor will in fading silks compose,<br />
Faintly the inimitable rose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—they are rightly praised by Mr Murry, and Pope, it is thought,
remembered and appropriated those others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the jonquille o'ercomes the feeble brain;<br />
We faint beneath the aromatic pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a thousand pities that the woman who could write like
that, whose mind was tuned to nature and reflection, should have
been forced to anger and bitterness. But how could she have helped
herself? I asked, imagining the sneers and the laughter, the
adulation of the toadies, the scepticism of the professional poet.
She must have shut herself up in a room in the country to write,
and been torn asunder by bitterness and scruples perhaps, though
her husband was of the kindest, and their married life perfection.
She 'must have', I say, because when one comes to seek out the
facts about Lady Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost
nothing is known about her. She suffered terribly from melancholy,
which we can explain at least to some extent when we find her
telling us how in the grip of it she would imagine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My lines decried, and my employment thought<br />
An useless folly or presumptuous fault:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The employment, which was thus censured, was, as far as one can
see, the harmless one of rambling about the fields and
dreaming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hand delights to trace unusual things,<br />
And deviates from the known and common way,<br />
Nor will in fading silks compose,<br />
Faintly the inimitable rose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, if that was her habit and that was her delight, she
could only expect to be laughed at; and, accordingly, Pope or Gay
is said to have satirized her 'as a blue-stocking with an itch for
scribbling'. Also it is thought that she offended Gay by laughing
at him. She said that his TRIVIA showed that 'he was more proper to
walk before a chair than to ride in one'. But this is all 'dubious
gossip' and, says Mr Murry, 'uninteresting'. But there I do not
agree with him, for I should have liked to have had more even of
dubious gossip so that I might have found out or made up some image
of this melancholy lady, who loved wandering in the fields and
thinking about unusual things and scorned, so rashly, so unwisely,
'the dull manage of a servile house'. But she became diffuse, Mr
Murry says. Her gift is all grown about with weeds and bound with
briars. It had no chance of showing itself for the fine
distinguished gift it was. And so, putting, her back on the shelf,
I turned to the other great lady, the Duchess whom Lamb loved,
hare-brained, fantastical Margaret of Newcastle, her elder, but her
contemporary. They were very different, but alike in this that both
were noble and both childless, and both were married to the best of
husbands. In both burnt the same passion for poetry and both are
disfigured and deformed by the same causes. Open the Duchess and
one finds the same outburst of rage. 'Women live like Bats or Owls,
labour like Beasts, and die like Worms… ' Margaret too might have
been a poet; in our day all that activity would have turned a wheel
of some sort. As it was, what could bind, tame or civilize for
human use that wild, generous, untutored intelligence? It poured
itself out, higgledy-piggledy, in torrents of rhyme and prose,
poetry and philosophy which stand congealed in quartos and folios
that nobody ever reads. She should have had a microscope put in her
hand. She should have been taught to look at the stars and reason
scientifically. Her wits were turned with solitude and freedom. No
one checked her. No one taught her. The professors fawned on her.
At Court they jeered at her. Sir Egerton Brydges complained of her
coarseness—'as flowing from a female of high rank brought up in the
Courts'. She shut herself up at Welbeck alone.</p>
<p>What a vision of loneliness and riot the thought of Margaret
Cavendish brings to mind! as if some giant cucumber had spread
itself over all the roses and carnations in the garden and choked
them to death. What a waste that the woman who wrote 'the best bred
women are those whose minds are civilest' should have frittered her
time away scribbling nonsense and plunging ever deeper into
obscurity and folly till the people crowded round her coach when
she issued out. Evidently the crazy Duchess became a bogey to
frighten clever girls with. Here, I remembered, putting away the
Duchess and opening Dorothy Osborne's letters, is Dorothy writing
to Temple about the Duchess's new book. 'Sure the poore woman is a
little distracted, shee could never bee soe rediculous else as to
venture at writeing book's and in verse too, if I should not sleep
this fortnight I should not come to that.'</p>
<p>And so, since no woman of sense and modesty could write books,
Dorothy, who was sensitive and melancholy, the very opposite of the
Duchess in temper, wrote nothing. Letters did not count. A woman
might write letters while she was sitting by her father's sick-bed.
She could write them by the fire whilst the men talked without
disturbing them. The strange thing is, I thought, turning over the
pages of Dorothy's letters, what a gift that untaught and solitary
girl had for the framing of a sentence, for the fashioning of a
scene. Listen to her running on:</p>
<p>'After dinner wee sitt and talk till Mr B. com's in question and
then I am gon. the heat of the day is spent in reading or working
and about sixe or seven a Clock, I walke out into a Common that
lyes hard by the house where a great many young wenches keep Sheep
and Cow's and sitt in the shades singing of Ballads; I goe to them
and compare their voyces and Beauty's to some Ancient Shepherdesses
that I have read of and finde a vaste difference there, but trust
mee I think these are as innocent as those could bee. I talke to
them, and finde they want nothing to make them the happiest People
in the world, but the knoledge that they are soe. most commonly
when we are in the middest of our discourse one looks aboute her
and spyes her Cow's goeing into the Corne and then away they all
run, as if they had wing's at theire heels. I that am not soe
nimble stay behinde, and when I see them driveing home theire
Cattle I think tis time for mee to retyre too. when I have supped I
goe into the Garden and soe to the syde of a small River that runs
by it where I sitt downe and wish you with mee… '</p>
<p>One could have sworn that she had the makings of a writer in
her. But 'if I should not sleep this fortnight I should not come to
that'—one can measure the opposition that was in the air to a woman
writing when one finds that even a woman with a great turn for
writing has brought herself to believe that to write a book was to
be ridiculous, even to show oneself distracted. And so we come, I
continued, replacing the single short volume of Dorothy Osborne's
letters upon the shelf, to Mrs Behn.</p>
<p>And with Mrs Behn we turn a very important corner on the road.
We leave behind, shut up in their parks among their folios, those
solitary great ladies who wrote without audience or criticism, for
their own delight alone. We come to town and rub shoulders with
ordinary people in the streets. Mrs Behn was a middle-class woman
with all the plebeian virtues of humour, vitality and courage; a
woman forced by the death of her husband and some unfortunate
adventures of her own to make her living by her wits. She had to
work on equal terms with men. She made, by working very hard,
enough to live on. The importance of that fact outweighs anything
that she actually wrote, even the splendid 'A Thousand Martyrs I
have made', or 'Love in Fantastic Triumph sat', for here begins the
freedom of the mind, or rather the possibility that in the course
of time the mind will be free to write what it likes. For now that
Aphra Behn had done it, girls could go to their parents and say,
You need not give me an allowance; I can make money by my pen. Of
course the answer for many years to come was, Yes, by living the
life of Aphra Behn! Death would be better! and the door was slammed
faster than ever. That profoundly interesting subject, the value
that men set upon women's chastity and its effect upon their
education, here suggests itself for discussion, and might provide
an interesting book if any student at Girton or Newnham cared to go
into the matter. Lady Dudley, sitting in diamonds among the midges
of a Scottish moor, might serve for frontispiece. Lord Dudley, THE
TIMES said when Lady Dudley died the other day, 'a man of
cultivated taste and many accomplishments, was benevolent and
bountiful, but whimsically despotic. He insisted upon his wife's
wearing full dress, even at the remotest shooting-lodge in the
Highlands; he loaded her with gorgeous jewels', and so on, 'he gave
her everything—always excepting any measure of responsibility'.
Then Lord Dudley had a stroke and she nursed him and ruled his
estates with supreme competence for ever after. That whimsical
despotism was in the nineteenth century too.</p>
<p>But to return. Aphra Behn proved that money could be made by
writing at the sacrifice, perhaps, of certain agreeable qualities;
and so by degrees writing became not merely a sign of folly and a
distracted mind, but was of practical importance. A husband might
die, or some disaster overtake the family. Hundreds of women began
as the eighteenth century drew on to add to their pin money, or to
come to the rescue of their families by making translations or
writing the innumerable bad novels which have ceased to be recorded
even in text-books, but are to be picked up in the fourpenny boxes
in the Charing Cross Road. The extreme activity of mind which
showed itself in the later eighteenth century among women—the
talking, and the meeting, the writing of essays on Shakespeare, the
translating of the classics—was founded on the solid fact that
women could make money by writing. Money dignifies what is
frivolous if unpaid for. It might still be well to sneer at 'blue
stockings with an itch for scribbling', but it could not be denied
that they could put money in their purses. Thus, towards the end of
the eighteenth century a change came about which, if I were
rewriting history, I should describe more fully and think of
greater importance than the Crusades or the Wars of the Roses.</p>
<p>The middle-class woman began to write. For if PRIDE AND
PREJUDICE matters, and MIDDLEMARCH and VILLETTE and WUTHERING
HEIGHTS matter, then it matters far more than I can prove in an
hour's discourse that women generally, and not merely the lonely
aristocrat shut up in her country house among her folios and her
flatterers, took to writing. Without those forerunners, Jane Austen
and the Brontës and George Eliot could no more have written than
Shakespeare could have written without Marlowe, or Marlowe without
Chaucer, or Chaucer without those forgotten poets who paved the
ways and tamed the natural savagery of the tongue. For masterpieces
are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many
years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people,
so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice. Jane
Austen should have laid a wreath upon the grave of Fanny Burney,
and George Eliot done homage to the robust shade of Eliza
Carter—the valiant old woman who tied a bell to her bedstead in
order that she might wake early and learn Greek. All women together
ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, which is,
most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey,
for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds. It
is she—shady and amorous as she was—who makes it not quite
fantastic for me to say to you to-night: Earn five hundred a year
by your wits.</p>
<p>Here, then, one had reached the early nineteenth century. And
here, for the first time, I found several shelves given up entirely
to the works of women. But why, I could not help asking, as I ran
my eyes over them, were they, with very few exceptions, all novels?
The original impulse was to poetry. The 'supreme head of song' was
a poetess. Both in France and in England the women poets precede
the women novelists. Moreover, I thought, looking at the four
famous names, what had George Eliot in common with Emily Brontë?
Did not Charlotte Brontë fail entirely to understand Jane Austen?
Save for the possibly relevant fact that not one of them had a
child, four more incongruous characters could not have met together
in a room—so much so that it is tempting to invent a meeting and a
dialogue between them. Yet by some strange force they were all
compelled when they wrote, to write novels. Had it something to do
with being born of the middle class, I asked; and with the fact,
which Miss Emily Davies a little later was so strikingly to
demonstrate, that the middle-class family in the early nineteenth
century was possessed only of a single sitting-room between them?
If a woman wrote, she would have to write in the common
sitting-room. And, as Miss Nightingale was so vehemently to
complain,—"women never have an half hour… that they can call their
own"—she was always interrupted. Still it would be easier to write
prose and fiction there than to write poetry or a play. Less
concentration is required. Jane Austen wrote like that to the end
of her days. 'How she was able to effect all this', her nephew
writes in his Memoir, 'is surprising, for she had no separate study
to repair to, and most of the work must have been done in the
general sitting-room, subject to all kinds of casual interruptions.
She was careful that her occupation should not be suspected by
servants or visitors or any persons beyond her own family
party<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_7" id=
"footnote_7_call">[7]</a>. Jane Austen hid her manuscripts or
covered them with a piece of blotting-paper. Then, again, all the
literary training that a woman had in the early nineteenth century
was training in the observation of character, in the analysis of
emotion. Her sensibility had been educated for centuries by the
influences of the common sitting-room. People's feelings were
impressed on her; personal relations were always before her eyes.
Therefore, when the middle-class woman took to writing, she
naturally wrote novels, even though, as seems evident enough, two
of the four famous women here named were not by nature novelists.
Emily Brontë should have written poetic plays; the overflow of
George Eliot's capacious mind should have spread itself when the
creative impulse was spent upon history or biography. They wrote
novels, however; one may even go further, I said, taking PRIDE AND
PREJUDICE from the shelf, and say that they wrote good novels.
Without boasting or giving pain to the opposite sex, one may say
that PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a good book. At any rate, one would not
have been ashamed to have been caught in the act of writing PRIDE
AND PREJUDICE. Yet Jane Austen was glad that a hinge creaked, so
that she might hide her manuscript before anyone came in. To Jane
Austen there was something discreditable in writing PRIDE AND
PREJUDICE. And, I wondered, would PRIDE AND PREJUDICE have been a
better novel if Jane Austen had not thought it necessary to hide
her manuscript from visitors? I read a page or two to see; but I
could not find any signs that her circumstances had harmed her work
in the slightest. That, perhaps, was the chief miracle about it.
Here was a woman about the year 1800 writing without hate, without
bitterness, without fear, without protest, without preaching. That
was how Shakespeare wrote, I thought, looking at ANTONY AND
CLEOPATRA; and when people compare Shakespeare and Jane Austen,
they may mean that the minds of both had consumed all impediments;
and for that reason we do not know Jane Austen and we do not know
Shakespeare, and for that reason Jane Austen pervades every word
that she wrote, and so does Shakespeare. If Jane Austen suffered in
any way from her circumstances it was in the narrowness of life
that was imposed upon her. It was impossible for a woman to go
about alone. She never travelled; she never drove through London in
an omnibus or had luncheon in a shop by herself. But perhaps it was
the nature of Jane Austen not to want what she had not. Her gift
and her circumstances matched each other completely. But I doubt
whether that was true of Charlotte Brontë, I said, opening JANE
EYRE and laying it beside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.</p>
<p>I opened it at chapter twelve and my eye was caught by the
phrase 'Anybody may blame me who likes'. What were they blaming
Charlotte Brontë for? I wondered. And I read how Jane Eyre used to
go up on to the roof when Mrs Fairfax was making jellies and looked
over the fields at the distant view. And then she longed—and it was
for this that they blamed her—that 'then I longed for a power of
vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy
world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen:
that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed;
more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of
character than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in
Mrs Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the
existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I
believed in I wished to behold.</p>
<p>'Who blames me? Many, no doubt, and I shall he called
discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my
nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes…</p>
<p>'It is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they
cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine,
and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows
how many rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people
earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel
just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties and a
field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer
from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as
men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged
fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to
making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and
embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at
them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has
pronounced necessary for their sex.</p>
<p>'When thus alone I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh…
'</p>
<p>That is an awkward break, I thought. It is upsetting to come
upon Grace Poole all of a sudden. The continuity is disturbed. One
might say, I continued, laying the book down beside PRIDE AND
PREJUDICE, that the woman who wrote those pages had more genius in
her than Jane Austen; but if one reads them over and marks that
jerk in them, that indignation, one sees that she will never get
her genius expressed whole and entire. Her books will be deformed
and twisted. She will write in a rage where she should write
calmly. She will write foolishly where she should write wisely. She
will write of herself where she should write of her characters. She
is at war with her lot. How could she help but die young, cramped
and thwarted?</p>
<p>One could not but play for a moment with the thought of what
might have happened if Charlotte Brontë had possessed say three
hundred a year—but the foolish woman sold the copyright of her
novels outright for fifteen hundred pounds; had somehow possessed
more knowledge of the busy world, and towns and regions full of
life; more practical experience, and intercourse with her kind and
acquaintance with a variety of character. In those words she puts
her finger exactly not only upon her own defects as a novelist but
upon those of her sex at that time. She knew, no one better, how
enormously her genius would have profited if it had not spent
itself in solitary visions over distant fields; if experience and
intercourse and travel had been granted her. But they were not
granted; they were withheld; and we must accept the fact that all
those good novels, VILLETTE, EMMA, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, MIDDLEMARCH,
were written by women without more experience of life than could
enter the house of a respectable clergyman; written too in the
common sitting-room of that respectable house and by women so poor
that they could not afford to buy more than a few quires of paper
at a time upon which to write WUTHERING HEIGHTS or JANE EYRE. One
of them, it is true, George Eliot, escaped after much tribulation,
but only to a secluded villa in St John's Wood. And there she
settled down in the shadow of the world's disapproval. 'I wish it
to be understood', she wrote, 'that I should never invite anyone to
come and see me who did not ask for the invitation'; for was she
not living in sin with a married man and might not the sight of her
damage the chastity of Mrs Smith or whoever it might be that
chanced to call? One must submit to the social convention, and be
'cut off from what is called the world'. At the same time, on the
other side of Europe, there was a young man living freely with this
gypsy or with that great lady; going to the wars; picking up
unhindered and uncensored all that varied experience of human life
which served him so splendidly later when he came to write his
books. Had Tolstoi lived at the Priory in seclusion with a married
lady 'cut off from what is called the world', however edifying the
moral lesson, he could scarcely, I thought, have written WAR AND
PEACE.</p>
<p>But one could perhaps go a little deeper into the question of
novel-writing and the effect of sex upon the novelist. If one shuts
one's eyes and thinks of the novel as a whole, it would seem to be
a creation owning a certain looking-glass likeness to life, though
of course with simplifications and distortions innumerable. At any
rate, it is a structure leaving a shape on the mind's eye, built
now in squares, now pagoda shaped, now throwing out wings and
arcades, now solidly compact and domed like the Cathedral of Saint
Sofia at Constantinople. This shape, I thought, thinking back over
certain famous novels, starts in one the kind of emotion that is
appropriate to it. But that emotion at once blends itself with
others, for the 'shape' is not made by the relation of stone to
stone, but by the relation of human being to human being. Thus a
novel starts in us all sorts of antagonistic and opposed emotions.
Life conflicts with something that is not life. Hence the
difficulty of coming to any agreement about novels, and the immense
sway that our private prejudices have upon us. On the one hand we
feel You—John the hero—must live, or I shall be in the depths of
despair. On the other, we feel, Alas, John, you must die, because
the shape of the book requires it. Life conflicts with something
that is not life. Then since life it is in part, we judge it as
life. James is the sort of man I most detest, one says. Or, This is
a farrago of absurdity. I could never feel anything of the sort
myself. The whole structure, it is obvious, thinking back on any
famous novel, is one of infinite complexity, because it is thus
made up of so many different judgements, of so many different kinds
of emotion. The wonder is that any book so composed holds together
for more than a year or two, or can possibly mean to the English
reader what it means for the Russian or the Chinese. But they do
hold together occasionally very remarkably. And what holds them
together in these rare instances of survival (I was thinking of WAR
AND PEACE) is something that one calls integrity, though it has
nothing to do with paying one's bills or behaving honourably in an
emergency. What one means by integrity, in the case of the
novelist, is the conviction that he gives one that this is the
truth. Yes, one feels, I should never have thought that this could
be so; I have never known people behaving like that. But you have
convinced me that so it is, so it happens. One holds every phrase,
every scene to the light as one reads—for Nature seems, very oddly,
to have provided us with an inner light by which to judge of the
novelist's integrity or disintegrity. Or perhaps it is rather that
Nature, in her most irrational mood, has traced in invisible ink on
the walls of the mind a premonition which these great artists
confirm; a sketch which only needs to be held to the fire of genius
to become visible. When one so exposes it and sees it come to life
one exclaims in rapture, But this is what I have always felt and
known and desired! And one boils over with excitement, and,
shutting the book even with a kind of reverence as if it were
something very precious, a stand-by to return to as long as one
lives, one puts it back on the shelf, I said, taking WAR AND PEACE
and putting it back in its place. If, on the other hand, these poor
sentences that one takes and tests rouse first a quick and eager
response with their bright colouring and their dashing gestures but
there they stop: something seems to check them in their
development: or if they bring to light only a faint scribble in
that corner and a blot over there, and nothing appears whole and
entire, then one heaves a sigh of disappointment and says. Another
failure. This novel has come to grief somewhere.</p>
<p>And for the most part, of course, novels do come to grief
somewhere. The imagination falters under the enormous strain. The
insight is confused; it can no longer distinguish between the true
and the false, it has no longer the strength to go on with the vast
labour that calls at every moment for the use of so many different
faculties. But how would all this be affected by the sex of the
novelist, I wondered, looking at JANE EYRE and the others. Would
the fact of her sex in any way interfere with the integrity of a
woman novelist—that integrity which I take to be the backbone of
the writer? Now, in the passages I have quoted from JANE EYRE, it
is clear that anger was tampering with the integrity of Charlotte
Brontë the novelist. She left her story, to which her entire
devotion was due, to attend to some personal grievance. She
remembered that she had been starved of her proper due of
experience—she had been made to stagnate in a parsonage mending
stockings when she wanted to wander free over the world. Her
imagination swerved from indignation and we feel it swerve. But
there were many more influences than anger tugging at her
imagination and deflecting it from its path. Ignorance, for
instance. The portrait of Rochester is drawn in the dark. We feel
the influence of fear in it; just as we constantly feel an acidity
which is the result of oppression, a buried suffering smouldering
beneath her passion, a rancour which contracts those books,
splendid as they are, with a spasm of pain.</p>
<p>And since a novel has this correspondence to real life, its
values are to some extent those of real life. But it is obvious
that the values of women differ very often from the values which
have been made by the other sex; naturally, this is so. Yet it is
the masculine values that prevail. Speaking crudely, football and
sport are 'important'; the worship of fashion, the buying of
clothes 'trivial'. And these values are inevitably transferred from
life to fiction. This is an important book, the critic assumes,
because it deals with war. This is an insignificant book because it
deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room. A scene in a
battle-field is more important than a scene in a shop—everywhere
and much more subtly the difference of value persists. The whole
structure, therefore, of the early nineteenth-century novel was
raised, if one was a woman, by a mind which was slightly pulled
from the straight, and made to alter its clear vision in deference
to external authority. One has only to skim those old forgotten
novels and listen to the tone of voice in which they are written to
divine that the writer was meeting criticism; she was saying this
by way of aggression, or that by way of conciliation. She was
admitting that she was 'only a woman', or protesting that she was
'as good as a man'. She met that criticism as her temperament
dictated, with docility and diffidence, or with anger and emphasis.
It does not matter which it was; she was thinking of something
other than the thing itself. Down comes her book upon our heads.
There was a flaw in the centre of it. And I thought of all the
women's novels that lie scattered, like small pock-marked apples in
an orchard, about the second-hand book shops of London. It was the
flaw in the centre that had rotted them. She had altered her values
in deference to the opinion of others.</p>
<p>But how impossible it must have been for them not to budge
either to the right or to the left. What genius, what integrity it
must have required in face of all that criticism, in the midst of
that purely patriarchal society, to hold fast to the thing as they
saw it without shrinking. Only Jane Austen did it and Emily Brontë.
It is another feather, perhaps the finest, in their caps. They
wrote as women write, not as men write. Of all the thousand women
who wrote novels then, they alone entirely ignored the perpetual
admonitions of the eternal pedagogue—write this, think that. They
alone were deaf to that persistent voice, now grumbling, now
patronizing, now domineering, now grieved, now shocked, now angry,
now avuncular, that voice which cannot let women alone, but must be
at them, like some too-conscientious governess, adjuring them, like
Sir Egerton Brydges, to be refined; dragging even into the
criticism of poetry criticism of sex;<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_8" id="footnote_8_call">[8]</a> admonishing
them, if they would be good and win, as I suppose, some shiny
prize, to keep within certain limits which the gentleman in
question thinks suitable—'… female novelists should only aspire to
excellence by courageously acknowledging the limitations of their
sex'.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_9" id=
"footnote_9_call">[9]</a> That puts the matter in a nutshell, and
when I tell you, rather to your surprise, that this sentence was
written not in August 1828 but in August 1928, you will agree, I
think, that however delightful it is to us now, it represents a
vast body of opinion—I am not going to stir those old pools; I take
only what chance has floated to my feet—that was far more vigorous
and far more vocal a century ago. It would have needed a very
stalwart young woman in 1828 to disregard all those snubs and
chidings and promises of prizes. One must have been something of a
firebrand to say to oneself, Oh, but they can't buy literature too.
Literature is open to everybody. I refuse to allow you, Beadle
though you are, to turn me off the grass. Lock up your libraries if
you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt, that you can set
upon the freedom of my mind.</p>
<p>But whatever effect discouragement and criticism had upon their
writing—and I believe that they had a very great effect—that was
unimportant compared with the other difficulty which faced them (I
was still considering those early nineteenth-century novelists)
when they came to set their thoughts on paper—that is that they had
no tradition behind them, or one so short and partial that it was
of little help. For we think back through our mothers if we are
women. It is useless to go to the great men writers for help,
however much one may go to them for pleasure. Lamb, Browne,
Thackeray, Newman, Sterne, Dickens, De Quincey—whoever it may
be—never helped a woman yet, though she may have learnt a few
tricks of them and adapted them to her use. The weight, the pace,
the stride of a man's mind are too unlike her own for her to lift
anything substantial from him successfully. The ape is too distant
to be sedulous. Perhaps the first thing she would find, setting pen
to paper, was that there was no common sentence ready for her use.
All the great novelists like Thackeray and Dickens and Balzac have
written a natural prose, swift but not slovenly, expressive but not
precious, taking their own tint without ceasing to be common
property. They have based it on the sentence that was current at
the time. The sentence that was current at the beginning of the
nineteenth century ran something like this perhaps: 'The grandeur
of their works was an argument with them, not to stop short, but to
proceed. They could have no higher excitement or satisfaction than
in the exercise of their art and endless generations of truth and
beauty. Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates
success.' That is a man's sentence; behind it one can see Johnson,
Gibbon and the rest. It was a sentence that was unsuited for a
woman's use. Charlotte Brontë, with all her splendid gift for
prose, stumbled and fell with that clumsy weapon in her hands.
George Eliot committed atrocities with it that beggar description.
Jane Austen looked at it and laughed at it and devised a perfectly
natural, shapely sentence proper for her own use and never departed
from it. Thus, with less genius for writing than Charlotte Brontë,
she got infinitely more said. Indeed, since freedom and fullness of
expression are of the essence of the art, such a lack of tradition,
such a scarcity and inadequacy of tools, must have told enormously
upon the writing of women. Moreover, a book is not made of
sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image
helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by
men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason
to think that the form of the epic or of the poetic play suit a
woman any more than the sentence suits her. But all the older forms
of literature were hardened and set by the time she became a
writer. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands
another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels. Yet who shall say
that even now 'the novel' (I give it inverted commas to mark my
sense of the words' inadequacy), who shall say that even this most
pliable of all forms is rightly shaped for her use? No doubt we
shall find her knocking that into shape for herself when she has
the free use of her limbs; and providing some new vehicle, not
necessarily in verse, for the poetry in her. For it is the poetry
that is still denied outlet. And I went on to ponder how a woman
nowadays would write a poetic tragedy in five acts. Would she use
verse?—would she not use prose rather?</p>
<p>But these are difficult questions which lie in the twilight of
the future. I must leave them, if only because they stimulate me to
wander from my subject into trackless forests where I shall be lost
and, very likely, devoured by wild beasts. I do not want, and I am
sure that you do not want me, to broach that very dismal subject,
the future of fiction. so that I will only pause here one moment to
draw your attention to the great part which must be played in that
future so far as women are concerned by physical conditions. The
book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one
would say that women's books should be shorter, more concentrated,
than those of men, and framed so that they do not need long hours
of steady and uninterrupted work. For interruptions there will
always be. Again, the nerves that feed the brain would seem to
differ in men and women, and if you are going to make them work
their best and hardest, you must find out what treatment suits
them—whether these hours of lectures, for instance, which the monks
devised, presumably, hundreds of years ago, suit them—what
alternations of work and rest they need, interpreting rest not as
doing nothing but as doing something but something that is
different; and what should that difference be? All this should be
discussed and discovered; all this is part of the question of women
and fiction. And yet, I continued, approaching the bookcase again,
where shall I find that elaborate study of the psychology of women
by a woman? If through their incapacity to play football women are
not going to be allowed to practise medicine—</p>
<p>Happily my thoughts were now given another turn.</p>
