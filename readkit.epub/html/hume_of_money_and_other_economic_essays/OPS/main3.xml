<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he greatness of a
state, and the happiness of its subjects, how independent soever
they may be supposed in some respects, are commonly allowed to be
inseparable with regard to commerce; and as private men receive
greater security, in the possession of their trade and riches, from
the power of the public, so the public becomes powerful in
proportion to the opulence and extensive commerce of private men.
This maxim is true in general; though I cannot forbear thinking,
that it may possibly admit of exceptions, and that we often
establish it with too little reserve and limitation. There may be
some circumstances, where the commerce and riches and luxury of
individuals, instead of adding strength to the public, will serve
only to thin its armies, and diminish its authority among the
neighbouring nations. Man is a very variable being, and susceptible
of many different opinions, principles, and rules of conduct. What
may be true, while he adheres to one way of thinking, will be found
false, when he has embraced an opposite set of manners and
opinions.</p>
<p>The bulk of every state may be divided into <em>husbandmen</em>
and <em>manufacturers</em>. The former are employed in the culture
of the land; the latter work up the materials furnished by the
former, into all the commodities which are necessary or ornamental
to human life. As soon as men quit their savage state, where they
live chiefly by hunting and fishing, they must fall into these two
classes; though the arts of agriculture employ <em>at first</em>
the most numerous part of the society.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_1" id="footnote_1_call">[1]</a> Time and
experience improve so much these arts, that the land may easily
maintain a much greater number of men, than those who are
immediately employed in its culture, or who furnish the more
necessary manufactures to such as are so employed.</p>
<p>If these superfluous hands apply themselves to the finer arts,
which are commonly denominated the arts of <em>luxury</em>, they
add to the happiness of the state; since they afford to many the
opportunity of receiving enjoyments, with which they would
otherwise have been unacquainted. But may not another scheme be
proposed for the employment of these superfluous hands? May not the
sovereign lay claim to them, and employ them in fleets and armies,
to encrease the dominions of the state abroad, and spread its fame
over distant nations? It is certain that the fewer desires and
wants are found in the proprietors and labourers of land, the fewer
hands do they employ; and consequently the superfluities of the
land, instead of maintaining tradesmen and manufacturers, may
support fleets and armies to a much greater extent, than where a
great many arts are required to minister to the luxury of
particular persons. Here therefore seems to be a kind of opposition
between the greatness of the state and the happiness of the
subject. A state is never greater than when all its superfluous
hands are employed in the service of the public. The ease and
convenience of private persons require, that these hands should be
employed in their service. The one can never be satisfied, but at
the expence of the other. As the ambition of the sovereign must
entrench on the luxury of individuals; so the luxury of individuals
must diminish the force, and check the ambition of the
sovereign.</p>
<p>Nor is this reasoning merely chimerical; but is founded on
history and experience. The republic of Sparta was certainly more
powerful than any state now in the world, consisting of an equal
number of people; and this was owing entirely to the want of
commerce and luxury. The Helotes were the labourers: The Spartans
were the soldiers or gentlemen. It is evident, that the labour of
the Helotes could not have maintained so great a number of
Spartans, had these latter lived in ease and delicacy, and given
employment to a great variety of trades and manufactures. The like
policy may be remarked in Rome. And indeed, throughout all ancient
history, it is observable, that the smallest republics raised and
maintained greater armies, than states consisting of triple the
number of inhabitants, are able to support at present. It is
computed, that, in all European nations, the proportion between
soldiers and people does not exceed one to a hundred. But we read,
that the city of Rome alone, with its small territory, raised and
maintained, in early times, ten legions against the Latins. Athens,
the whole of whose dominions was not larger than Yorkshire, sent to
the expedition against Sicily near forty thousand men.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_2" id=
"footnote_2_call">[2]</a> Dionysius the elder, it is said,
maintained a standing army of a hundred thousand foot and ten
thousand horse, besides a large fleet of four hundred
sail;<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_3" id=
"footnote_3_call">[3]</a> though his territories extended no
farther than the city of Syracuse, about a third of the island of
Sicily, and some sea-port towns and garrisons on the coast of Italy
and Illyricum. It is true, the ancient armies, in time of war,
subsisted much upon plunder: But did not the enemy plunder in their
turn? which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax, than any other
that could be devised. In short, no probable reason can be assigned
for the great power of the more ancient states above the modern,
but their want of commerce and luxury. Few artizans were maintained
by the labour of the farmers, and therefore more soldiers might
live upon it. Livy says, that Rome, in his time, would find it
difficult to raise as large an army as that which, in her early
days, she sent out against the Gauls and Latins.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_4" id="footnote_4_call">[4]</a>
Instead of those soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in
Camillus’s time, there were, in Augustus’s days, musicians,
painters, cooks, players, and tailors; and if the land was equally
cultivated at both periods, it could certainly maintain equal
numbers in the one profession as in the other. They added nothing
to the mere necessaries of life, in the latter period more than in
the former.</p>
<p>It is natural on this occasion to ask, whether sovereigns may
not return to the maxims of ancient policy, and consult their own
interest in this respect, more than the happiness of their
subjects? I answer, that it appears to me, almost impossible; and
that because ancient policy was violent, and contrary to the more
natural and usual course of things. It is well known with what
peculiar laws Sparta was governed, and what a prodigy that republic
is justly esteemed by every one, who has considered human nature as
it has displayed itself in other nations, and other ages. Were the
testimony of history less positive and circumstantial, such a
government would appear a mere philosophical whim or fiction, and
impossible ever to be reduced to practice. And though the Roman and
other ancient republics were supported on principles somewhat more
natural, yet was there an extraordinary concurrence of
circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burthens. They
were free states; they were small ones; and the age being martial,
all their neighbours were continually in arms. Freedom naturally
begets public spirit, especially in small states; and this public
spirit, this <em>amor patriae</em>, must encrease, when the public
is almost in continual alarm, and men are obliged, every moment, to
expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defence. A
continual succession of wars makes every citizen a soldier: He
takes the field in his turn: And during his service he is chiefly
maintained by himself. This service is indeed equivalent to a heavy
tax; yet is it less felt by a people addicted to arms, who fight
for honour and revenge more than pay, and are unacquainted with
gain and industry as well as pleasure.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_5" id="footnote_5_call">[5]</a> Not to
mention the great equality of fortunes among the inhabitants of the
ancient republics, where every field, belonging to a different
proprietor, was able to maintain a family, and rendered the numbers
of citizens very considerable, even without trade and
manufactures.</p>
<p>But though the want of trade and manufactures, among a free and
very martial people, may sometimes have no other effect than to
render the public more powerful, it is certain, that, in the common
course of human affairs, it will have a quite contrary tendency.
Sovereigns must take mankind as they find them, and cannot pretend
to introduce any violent change in their principles and ways of
thinking. A long course of time, with a variety of accidents and
circumstances, are requisite to produce those great revolutions,
which so much diversify the face of human affairs. And the less
natural any set of principles are, which support a particular
society, the more difficulty will a legislator meet with in raising
and cultivating them. It is his best policy to comply with the
common bent of mankind, and give it all the improvements of which
it is susceptible. Now, according to the most natural course of
things, industry and arts and trade encrease the power of the
sovereign as well as the happiness of the subjects; and that policy
is violent, which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of
individuals. This will easily appear from a few considerations,
which will present to us the consequences of sloth and
barbarity.</p>
<p>Where manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated, the
bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture; and if
their skill and industry encrease, there must arise a great
superfluity from their labour beyond what suffices to maintain
them. They have no temptation, therefore, to encrease their skill
and industry; since they cannot exchange that superfluity for any
commodities, which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity. A
habit of indolence naturally prevails. The greater part of the land
lies uncultivated. What is cultivated, yields not its utmost for
want of skill and assiduity in the farmers. If at any time the
public exigencies require, that great numbers should be employed in
the public service, the labour of the people furnishes now no
superfluities, by which these numbers can be maintained. The
labourers cannot encrease their skill and industry on a sudden.
Lands uncultivated cannot be brought into tillage for some years.
The armies, mean while, must either make sudden and violent
conquests, or disband for want of subsistence. A regular attack or
defence, therefore, is not to be expected from such a people, and
their soldiers must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers
and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Every thing in the world is purchased by labour; and our
passions are the only causes of labour. When a nation abounds in
manufactures and mechanic arts, the proprietors of land, as well as
the farmers, study agriculture as a science, and redouble their
industry and attention. The superfluity, which arises from their
labour, is not lost; but is exchanged with manufactures for those
commodities, which men’s luxury now makes them covet. By this
means, land furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life,
than what suffices for those who cultivate it. In times of peace
and tranquillity, this superfluity goes to the maintenance of
manufacturers, and the improvers of liberal arts. But it is easy
for the public to convert many of these manufacturers into
soldiers, and maintain them by that superfluity, which arises from
the labour of the farmers. Accordingly we find, that this is the
case in all civilized governments. When the sovereign raises an
army, what is the consequence? He imposes a tax. This tax obliges
all the people to retrench what is least necessary to their
subsistence. Those, who labour in such commodities, must either
enlist in the troops, or turn themselves to agriculture, and
thereby oblige some labourers to enlist for want of business. And
to consider the matter abstractedly, manufactures encrease the
power of the state only as they store up so much labour, and that
of a kind to which the public may lay claim, without depriving any
one of the necessaries of life. The more labour, therefore, is
employed beyond mere necessaries, the more powerful is any state;
since the persons engaged in that labour may easily be converted to
the public service. In a state without manufactures, there may be
the same number of hands; but there is not the same quantity of
labour, nor of the same kind. All the labour is there bestowed upon
necessaries, which can admit of little or no abatement.</p>
<p>Thus the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the
state are, in a great measure, united with regard to trade and
manufactures. It is a violent method, and in most cases
impracticable, to oblige the labourer to toil, in order to raise
from the land more than what subsists himself and family. Furnish
him with manufactures and commodities, and he will do it of
himself. Afterwards you will find it easy to seize some part of his
superfluous labour, and employ it in the public service, without
giving him his wonted return. Being accustomed to industry, he will
think this less grievous, than if, at once, you obliged him to an
augmentation of labour without any reward. The case is the same
with regard to the other members of the state. The greater is the
stock of labour of all kinds, the greater quantity may be taken
from the heap, without making any sensible alteration in it.</p>
<p>A public granary of corn, a storehouse of cloth, a magazine of
arms; all these must be allowed real riches and strength in any
state. Trade and industry are really nothing but a stock of labour,
which, in times of peace and tranquillity, is employed for the ease
and satisfaction of individuals; but in the exigencies of state,
may, in part, be turned to public advantage. Could we convert a
city into a kind of fortified camp, and infuse into each breast so
martial a genius, and such a passion for public good, as to make
every one willing to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of
the public; these affections might now, as in ancient times, prove
alone a sufficient spur to industry, and support the community. It
would then be advantageous, as in camps, to banish all arts and
luxury; and, by restrictions on equipage and tables, make the
provisions and forage last longer than if the army were loaded with
a number of superfluous retainers. But as these principles are too
disinterested and too difficult to support, it is requisite to
govern men by other passions, and animate them with a spirit of
avarice and industry, art and luxury. The camp is, in this case,
loaded with a superfluous retinue; but the provisions flow in
proportionably larger. The harmony of the whole is still supported;
and the natural bent of the mind being more complied with,
individuals, as well as the public, find their account in the
observance of those maxims.</p>
<p>The same method of reasoning will let us see the advantage of
<em>foreign</em> commerce, in augmenting the power of the state, as
well as the riches and happiness of the subject. It encreases the
stock of labour in the nation; and the sovereign may convert what
share of it he finds necessary to the service of the public.
Foreign trade, by its imports, furnishes materials for new
manufactures; and by its exports, it produces labour in particular
commodities, which could not be consumed at home. In short, a
kingdom, that has a large import and export, must abound more with
industry, and that employed upon delicacies and luxuries, than a
kingdom which rests contented with its native commodities. It is,
therefore, more powerful, as well as richer and happier. The
individuals reap the benefit of these commodities, so far as they
gratify the senses and appetites. And the public is also a gainer,
while a greater stock of labour is, by this means, stored up
against any public exigency; that is, a greater number of laborious
men are maintained, who may be diverted to the public service,
without robbing any one of the necessaries, or even the chief
conveniencies of life.</p>
<p>If we consult history, we shall find, that, in most nations,
foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures, and
given birth to domestic luxury. The temptation is stronger to make
use of foreign commodities, which are ready for use, and which are
entirely new to us, than to make improvements on any domestic
commodity, which always advance by slow degrees, and never affect
us by their novelty. The profit is also very great, in exporting
what is superfluous at home, and what bears no price, to foreign
nations, whose soil or climate is not favourable to that commodity.
Thus men become acquainted with the <em>pleasures</em> of luxury
and the <em>profits</em> of commerce; and their <em>delicacy</em>
and <em>industry</em>, being once awakened, carry them on to
farther improvements, in every branch of domestic as well as
foreign trade. And this perhaps is the chief advantage which arises
from a commerce with strangers. It rouses men from their indolence;
and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with
objects of luxury, which they never before dreamed of, raises in
them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their
ancestors enjoyed. And at the same time, the few merchants, who
possess the secret of this importation and exportation, make great
profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility,
tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce.
Imitation soon diffuses all those arts; while domestic manufactures
emulate the foreign in their improvements, and work up every home
commodity to the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible.
Their own steel and iron, in such laborious hands, become equal to
the gold and rubies of the Indies.</p>
<p>When the affairs of the society are once brought to this
situation, a nation may lose most of its foreign trade, and yet
continue a great and powerful people. If strangers will not take
any particular commodity of ours, we must cease to labour in it.
The same hands will turn themselves towards some refinement in
other commodities, which may be wanted at home. And there must
always be materials for them to work upon; till every person in the
state, who possesses riches, enjoys as great plenty of home
commodities, and those in as great perfection, as he desires; which
can never possibly happen. China is represented as one of the most
flourishing empires in the world; though it has very little
commerce beyond its own territories.</p>
<p>It will not, I hope, be considered as a superfluous digression,
if I here observe, that, as the multitude of mechanical arts is
advantageous, so is the great number of persons to whose share the
productions of these arts fall. A too great disproportion among the
citizens weakens any state. Every person, if possible, ought to
enjoy the fruits of his labour, in a full possession of all the
necessaries, and many of the conveniencies of life. No one can
doubt, but such an equality is most suitable to human nature, and
diminishes much less from the <em>happiness</em> of the rich than
it adds to that of the poor. It also augments the <em>power of the
state</em>, and makes any extraordinary taxes or impositions be
paid with more chearfulness. Where the riches are engrossed by a
few, these must contribute very largely to the supplying of the
public necessities. But when the riches are dispersed among
multitudes, the burthen feels light on every shoulder, and the
taxes make not a very sensible difference on any one’s way of
living.</p>
<p>Add to this, that, where the riches are in few hands, these must
enjoy all the power, and will readily conspire to lay the whole
burthen on the poor, and oppress them still farther, to the
discouragement of all industry.</p>
<p>In this circumstance consists the great advantage of England
above any nation at present in the world, or that appears in the
records of any story. It is true, the English feel some
disadvantages in foreign trade by the high price of labour, which
is in part the effect of the riches of their artisans, as well as
of the plenty of money: But as foreign trade is not the most
material circumstance, it is not to be put in competition with the
happiness of so many millions. And if there were no more to endear
to them that free government under which they live, this alone were
sufficient. The poverty of the common people is a natural, if not
an infallible effect of absolute monarchy; though I doubt, whether
it be always true, on the other hand, that their riches are an
infallible result of liberty. Liberty must be attended with
particular accidents, and a certain turn of thinking, in order to
produce that effect. Lord Bacon, accounting for the great
advantages obtained by the English in their wars with France,
ascribes them chiefly to the superior ease and plenty of the common
people amongst the former; yet the government of the two kingdoms
was, at that time, pretty much alike. Where the labourers and
artisans are accustomed to work for low wages, and to retain but a
small part of the fruits of their labour, it is difficult for them,
even in a free government, to better their condition, or conspire
among themselves to heighten their wages. But even where they are
accustomed to a more plentiful way of life, it is easy for the
rich, in an arbitrary government, to conspire against them, and
throw the whole burthen of the taxes on their shoulders.</p>
<p>It may seem an odd position, that the poverty of the common
people in France, Italy, and Spain, is, in some measure, owing to
the superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate; yet
there want not reasons to justify this paradox. In such a fine
mould or soil as that of those more southern regions, agriculture
is an easy art; and one man, with a couple of sorry horses, will be
able, in a season, to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty
considerable rent to the proprietor. All the art, which the farmer
knows, is to leave his ground fallow for a year, as soon as it is
exhausted; and the warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the
climate enrich it, and restore its fertility. Such poor peasants,
therefore, require only a simple maintenance for their labour. They
have no stock or riches, which claim more; and at the same time,
they are for ever dependant on their landlord, who gives no leases,
nor fears that his land will be spoiled by the ill methods of
cultivation. In England, the land is rich, but coarse; must be
cultivated at a great expence; and produces slender crops, when not
carefully managed, and by a method which gives not the full profit
but in a course of several years. A farmer, therefore, in England
must have a considerable stock, and a long lease; which beget
proportional profits. The fine vineyards of Champagne and Burgundy,
that often yield to the landlord above five pounds per acre, are
cultivated by peasants, who have scarcely bread: The reason is,
that such peasants need no stock but their own limbs, with
instruments of husbandry, which they can buy for twenty shillings.
The farmers are commonly in some better circumstances in those
countries. But the grasiers are most at their ease of all those who
cultivate the land. The reason is still the same. Men must have
profits proportionable to their expence and hazard. Where so
considerable a number of the labouring poor as the peasants and
farmers are in very low circumstances, all the rest must partake of
their poverty, whether the government of that nation be monarchical
or republican.</p>
<p>We may form a similar remark with regard to the general history
of mankind. What is the reason, why no people, living between the
tropics, could ever yet attain to any art or civility, or reach
even any police in their government, and any military discipline;
while few nations in the temperate climates have been altogether
deprived of these advantages? It is probable that one cause of this
phaenomenon is the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid
zone, which render clothes and houses less requisite for the
inhabitants, and thereby remove, in part, that necessity, which is
the great spur to industry and invention. <em>Curis acuens mortalia
corda</em>. Not to mention, that the fewer goods or possessions of
this kind any people enjoy, the fewer quarrels are likely to arise
amongst them, and the less necessity will there be for a settled
police or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign
enemies, or from each other.</p>
