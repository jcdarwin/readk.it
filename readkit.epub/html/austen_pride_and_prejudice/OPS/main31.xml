<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ir William stayed
only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince
him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her
possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often
met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country;
but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual
employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not
see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time
between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work
in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the
window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in
which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather
wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for
common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant
aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason
for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much
less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.</p>
<p>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the
lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what
carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove
by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of,
though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped
at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with
Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.</p>
<p>Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to
Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary
to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be
other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand
the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured
with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation
that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into
their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it
differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or
detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any
refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that
Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.</p>
<p>Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active
magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were
carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers
were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she
sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence
their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.</p>
<p>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice
a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being
only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was
the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as
the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr.
Collins's reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon
the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were
half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather
was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment
out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went
while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open
grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice
sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where
she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.</p>
<p>In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed
away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to
bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a
circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her
arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few
weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she
did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to
look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing
how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour
to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady
Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction,
spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost
angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss
Lucas and herself.</p>
<p>His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was
walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into
Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and
after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried
home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he
hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of
Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him
a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and,
to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,
the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her
husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:</p>
<p>"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy
would never have come so soon to wait upon me."</p>
<p>Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the
compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,
and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not
handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.
Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire—paid
his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and
whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with
every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him
without saying a word.</p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly;
but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the
house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without
speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far
awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause,
added:</p>
<p>"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you
never happened to see her there?"</p>
<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to
see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed
between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little
confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to
meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the
gentlemen soon afterwards went away.</p>
