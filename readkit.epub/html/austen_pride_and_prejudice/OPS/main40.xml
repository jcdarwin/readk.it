<div class="text">
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was the second
week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from
Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and, as
they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to
meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room
upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place,
happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the
sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.</p>
<p>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a
table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords,
exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable
surprise?"</p>
<p>"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend
us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."
Then, showing her purchases—"Look here, I have bought this bonnet.
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy
it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see
if I can make it up any better."</p>
<p>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the
shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim
it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will
not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have
left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."</p>
<p>"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest
satisfaction.</p>
<p>"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want
papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a
delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.
Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a
miserable summer else we shall have!"</p>
<p>"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "<em>that</em>&#160;would be a
delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good
Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have
been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the
monthly balls of Meryton!"</p>
<p>"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down
at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and
about a certain person we all like!"</p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told
he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:</p>
<p>"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You
thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he
often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an
ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in
my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too
good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's
marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle
at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."</p>
<p>"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a
connection imprudent as to fortune."</p>
<p>"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."</p>
<p>"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said
Jane.</p>
<p>"I am sure there is not on&#160;<em>his</em>. I will answer for
it, he never cared three straws about her—who could about such a
nasty little freckled thing?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of&#160;<em>expression</em>&#160;herself, the coarseness
of the<em>sentiment</em>&#160;was little other than her own breast
had harboured and fancied liberal!</p>
<p>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage
was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all
their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of
Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.</p>
<p>"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I
bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another
bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk
and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear
what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any
pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that
one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will
be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost
three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being
married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken
Mr. Collins; but&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;do not think there would have
been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before
any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.
Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel
Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the
bye, Mrs. Forster and me are&#160;<em>such</em>&#160;friends!) and
so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and
so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think
we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to
pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but
Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we
were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how
well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should
have died. And&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."</p>
<p>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes,
did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to
amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened
as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent
mention of Wickham's name.</p>
<p>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to
see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner
did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:</p>
<p>"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."</p>
<p>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the
Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the
subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet
was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the
present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the
other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a
voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the
various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.</p>
<p>"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had
such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and
pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so
all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the
George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the
other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you
would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we
came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into
the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so
merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody
might have heard us ten miles off!"</p>
<p>To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear
sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be
congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they
would have no charms for&#160;<em>me</em>—I should infinitely
prefer a book."</p>
<p>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened
to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary
at all.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to
walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth
steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss
Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit
of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition.
She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it
as long as possible. The comfort to&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;of the
regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a
fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.</p>
<p>She had not been many hours at home before she found that the
Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,
was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw
directly that her father had not the smallest intention of
yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and
equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never
yet despaired of succeeding at last.</p>
