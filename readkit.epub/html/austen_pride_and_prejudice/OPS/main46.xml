<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth had
settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the
very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that
morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning
after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been
walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were
just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the
same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window,
and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the
street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what
it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her
relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her
manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of
the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea
on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they
felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions
from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the
perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment
increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but
amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality
of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more
than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every
power of pleasing would fail her.</p>
<p>She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she
walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw
such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made
everything worse.</p>
<p>Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable
introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that
her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was
exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes
convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it
difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.</p>
<p>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,
though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her
appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her
brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her
manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had
expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as
ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such
different feelings.</p>
<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that
Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to
express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when
Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he
entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long
done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood
its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he
expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly,
though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the
same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting
personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The
whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The
suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece
directed their observation towards each with an earnest though
guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full
conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of
the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the
gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain
the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her
own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter
object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of
success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were
prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager,
and Darcy determined, to be pleased.</p>
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;
and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were
directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked
less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself
with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a
resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be
deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as
a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke
particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify
the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and
two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which,
in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not
untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might
lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which
had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could
reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since
the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at
Netherfield."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he
afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of
the rest, whether&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;her sisters were at
Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding
remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them
meaning.</p>
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy
himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an
expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she
heard an accent so removed from&#160;<em>hauteur</em>&#160;or
disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of
manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its
existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw
him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of
people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to
the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected
their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the
change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she
could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,
even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his
dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to
please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now,
when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours,
and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were
addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies
both of Netherfield and Rosings.</p>
<p>Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when
they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in
expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss
Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss
Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the
habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked
at her niece, desirous of knowing how&#160;<em>she</em>, whom the
invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but
Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this
studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any
dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage
for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.</p>
<p>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing
Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many
inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth,
construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister,
was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found
herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the
last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing,
the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful
of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them
only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and
then hurried away to dress.</p>
<p>But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity;
it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident
that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had
before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love
with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify
inquiry.</p>
<p>Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,
as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.
They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn
his character from their own feelings and his servant's report,
without any reference to any other account, the circle in
Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it
for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the
housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a
servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose
own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily
rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and
if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the
poor.</p>
<p>With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was
not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his
concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it
was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had
left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards
discharged.</p>
<p>As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening
more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed
long, was not long enough to determine her feelings
towards&#160;<em>one</em>&#160;in that mansion; and she lay awake
two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did
not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost
as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that
could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for
some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now
heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony
so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so
amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above
respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which
could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely
for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to
forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting
him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He
who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy,
seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the
acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any
peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned,
was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making
her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride
exciting not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was
of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it
could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was
grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she
only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon
herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she
should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.</p>
<p>It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the
niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to
see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had
reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though
it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their
side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait
on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to
go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the
reason, she had very little to say in reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme
had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of
his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.</p>
