<p>Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.</p>
<p>We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is
working loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it,
sir?”</p>
<p>“Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them
up now.”</p>
<p>“Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”</p>
<p>“Well.”</p>
<p>“The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”</p>
<p>“Strike nothing, and stir nothing but lash everything. The wind
rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see
to it.— By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper
of some coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho,
gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this
brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike
that? Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest
time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e’en take it for
sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take
medicine, take medicine!”</p>
