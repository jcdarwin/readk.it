<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Bennet had
very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of
spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the
better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for
whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The
satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men
in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its
proper place.</p>
<p>He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage
to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his
brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the
extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon
as he could.</p>
<p>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be
perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son
was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of
age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be
provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but
yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after
Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at
last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs.
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of
independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.</p>
<p>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.
Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be
divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.
This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now
to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding
to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for
the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he
then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was
done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been
made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be
prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little
inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would
scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to
be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and
the continual presents in money which passed to her through her
mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that
sum.</p>
<p>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,
too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was
to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the
first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking
her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.
His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking
business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further
particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too
angry with Lydia to send any message to her.</p>
<p>The good news spread quickly through the house, and with
proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the
latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more
for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon
the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the
world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked
of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing
which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in
Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of
circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was
considered certain.</p>
<p>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on
this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,
and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp
to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the
first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the
point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly
on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new
carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the
neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without
knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as
deficient in size and importance.</p>
<p>"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit
it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;
but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles
from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."</p>
<p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while
the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:
"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your
son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.
Into<em>one</em>&#160;house in this neighbourhood they shall never
have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by
receiving them at Longbourn."</p>
<p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was
firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement
and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy
clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from
him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet
could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such
a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a
privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid,
exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the
disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her
daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and
living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the
distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with
their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly
give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to
conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not
immediately on the spot.</p>
<p>She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more
confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose
knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so
much—not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it
individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf
impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the
most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy
would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.</p>
<p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would
shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured
herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational
expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was
grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became
jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be
benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the
least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she
could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.</p>
<p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that
the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,
would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as
generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but
while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.</p>
<p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by
her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his
manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and
knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater
importance.</p>
<p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring
multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a
different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other,
was soon to be formed in their family.</p>
<p>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable
independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent
happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together
because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could
easily conjecture.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness
to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with
entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr.
Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.</p>
<p>"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as
soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with
me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,
both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention
to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are
still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He
has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now
quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from
this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among
different people, where they may each have a character to preserve,
they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster,
to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he
will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near
Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have
pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall
subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all
his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has
our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then
join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and
I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of
seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs
to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.—Yours, etc.,</p>
<p>"E. GARDINER."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's
removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But
Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled
in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in
her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their
residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and,
besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a
regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many
favourites.</p>
<p>"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite
shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men,
too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant
in General ——'s regiment."</p>
<p>His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of
being admitted into her family again before she set off for the
North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and
Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's
feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her
marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally
and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon
as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they
thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the
satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married
daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North.
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his
permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a
scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting
with him would have been the last object of her wishes.</p>
