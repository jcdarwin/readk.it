<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Bennet's
property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a
year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill
supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in
Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.</p>
<p>She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk
to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother
settled in London in a respectable line of trade.</p>
<p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt
and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the
family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these
attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and
when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to
amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening;
and however bare of news the country in general might be, they
always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed,
they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent
arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to
remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.</p>
<p>Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their
knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings
were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the
officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened
to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk
of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the
mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in
their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.</p>
<p>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,
Mr. Bennet coolly observed:</p>
<p>"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must
be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it
some time, but I am now convinced."</p>
<p>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with
perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of
Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the
day, as he was going the next morning to London.</p>
<p>"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should
be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think
slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own,
however."</p>
<p>"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of
it."</p>
<p>"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."</p>
<p>"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not
agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every
particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two
youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare
say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I
remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,
indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,
with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I
shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very
becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."</p>
<p>"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and
Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when
they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's
library."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the
footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and
the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with
pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter
read,</p>
<p>"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."</p>
<p>"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it
aloud.</p>
<p>"MY DEAR FRIEND,—</p>
<p>"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa
and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of
our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can
never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of
this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the
officers.—Yours ever,</p>
<p>"CAROLINE BINGLEY"</p>
<p>"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell
us of&#160;<em>that</em>."</p>
<p>"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."</p>
<p>"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.</p>
<p>"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems
likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."</p>
<p>"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure
that they would not offer to send her home."</p>
<p>"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to
Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."</p>
<p>"I had much rather go in the coach."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"</p>
<p>"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get
them."</p>
<p>"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's
purpose will be answered."</p>
<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that
the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on
horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many
cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane
had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were
uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued
the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not
come back.</p>
<p>"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more
than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the
felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a
servant from Netherfield brought the following note for
Elizabeth:</p>
<p>"MY DEAREST LIZZY,—</p>
<p>"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to
be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends
will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on
my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache,
there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, etc."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the
note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of
illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it
was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."</p>
<p>"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she
stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could
have the carriage."</p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,
though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no
horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her
resolution.</p>
<p>"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of
such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when
you get there."</p>
<p>"I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want."</p>
<p>"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is
nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by
dinner."</p>
<p>"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but
every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my
opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is
required."</p>
<p>"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies
set off together.</p>
<p>"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps
we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."</p>
<p>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the
lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her
walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping
over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and
finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary
ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of
exercise.</p>
<p>She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane
were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the
day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible
to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that
they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very
politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was
something better than politeness; there was good humour and
kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which
exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the
occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.</p>
<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably
answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very
feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad
to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been
withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from
expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was
delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much
conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could
attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently
attended her.</p>
<p>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and
Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much
affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came,
and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that
she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get
the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her
some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish
symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not
quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent;
the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do
elsewhere.</p>
<p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go,
and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the
carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when
Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley
was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to
remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully
consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint
the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.</p>
