morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes
before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying
the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.</p>
<p>"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has
yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am
very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her
thanks for it. The favor of your company has been much felt, I
assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our
humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few
domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford
extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will
believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done
everything in our power to prevent your spending your time
unpleasantly."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of
being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received,
must make&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was
gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:</p>
<p>"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very
superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the
frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may
flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been
entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's
family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing
which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how
continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that,
with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not
think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."</p>
<p>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and
he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to
unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.</p>
<p>"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you
will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it
does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on
this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you,
my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially
wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have
but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most
remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem
to have been designed for each other."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where
that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she
firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not
sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady
from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave
her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and
though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did
not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her
parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not
yet lost their charms.</p>
<p>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the
parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an
affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to
the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he
was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not
forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn
in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though
unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on
the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with
some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any
message for the ladies at Rosings.</p>
<p>"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble
respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their
kindness to you while you have been here."</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be
shut, and the carriage drove off.</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it
seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things
have happened!"</p>
<p>"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.</p>
<p>"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice! How much I shall have to tell!"</p>
<p>Elizabeth added privately, "And how much I shall have to
conceal!"</p>
<p>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any
alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached
Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.</p>
<p>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of
studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the
kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home
with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for
observation.</p>
<p>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait
even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's
proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would
so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly
gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to
reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could
have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as
to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she
once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating
something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.</p>
