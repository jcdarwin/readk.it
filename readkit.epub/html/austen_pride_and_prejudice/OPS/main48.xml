<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth had been
a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their
first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed
on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the
third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked
that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at
it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.</p>
<p>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all
their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country
afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and
written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It
was to this effect:</p>
<p>"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred
of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of
alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say
relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just
as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that
she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the
truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it
does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So
imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best,
and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and
indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us
rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her
nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it
better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been
said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off
Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed
till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly.
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left
a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must
conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you
will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have
written."</p>
<p>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely
knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly
seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read
as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of
the first.</p>
<p>"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day
before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to
Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief
that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which
was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set
off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them
easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they
removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought
them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were
seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After
making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came
on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the
turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any
success—no such people had been seen to pass through. With the
kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his
apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am
sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any
blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My
father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of
him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be
married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even
if&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;could form such a design against a young
woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,
that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he
shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was
not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps
her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is
not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him
so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their
attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot
wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared
something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock
is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so
selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not;
but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you
all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt
so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still
something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London
with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he
means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will
not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and
Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow
evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance
would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend
what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."</p>
<p>"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from
her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,
without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached
the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her
pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could
recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was
superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your
pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment,
on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to
lose."</p>
<p>"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a
minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself."</p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she
felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though
in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to
fetch his master and mistress home instantly.</p>
<p>On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support
herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for
Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of
gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there
nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine;
shall I get you one? You are very ill."</p>
<p>"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only
distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from
Longbourn."</p>
<p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes
could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could
only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in
compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had
a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed
from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped;
has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone
off together from Brighton.&#160;<em>You</em>&#160;know him too
well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing
that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever."</p>
<p>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in
a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who
knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some
part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been
known, this could not have happened. But it is all—all too late
now."</p>
<p>"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it
certain—absolutely certain?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were
traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not
gone to Scotland."</p>
<p>"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover
her?"</p>
<p>"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my
uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in
half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing
can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even
to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way
horrible!"</p>
<p>Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.</p>
<p>"When&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;eyes were opened to his real
character—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I
knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched
mistake!"</p>
<p>Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was
walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow
contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly
understood it. Her power was sinking;
everything&#160;<em>must</em>&#160;sink under such a proof of
family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She
could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his
self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no
palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly
calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she
so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all
love must be vain.</p>
<p>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.
Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all,
soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with
her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and,
after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of
her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner
which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,
"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I
anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing
concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done
on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I
will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to
ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent
my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
to-day."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say
that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy
truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."</p>
<p>He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his
sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there
was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her
relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.</p>
<p>As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was
that they should ever see each other again on such terms of
cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and
as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their
acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at
the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted
its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its
termination.</p>
<p>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,
Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor
faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is
unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often
described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even
before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her
defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the
latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill
success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less
interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she
entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but
Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While
the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all
surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it
was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever
have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all
too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have
sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be
deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of
marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her
virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an
easy prey.</p>
<p>She had never perceived, while the regiment was in
Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was
convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to
anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her
favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her
affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an
object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards
such a girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!</p>
<p>She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot
to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her,
in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of
exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost
persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's
interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered
the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had
hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that
their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly
on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons,
reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of
the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner
promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting
no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being
actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was
speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But
what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John
told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our
engagement.&#160;<em>That</em>&#160;is all settled."</p>
<p>"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her
room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to
disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"</p>
<p>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her
in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth
been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that
all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but
she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the
rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at
Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,
however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having
settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to
go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found
herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed,
seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.</p>
