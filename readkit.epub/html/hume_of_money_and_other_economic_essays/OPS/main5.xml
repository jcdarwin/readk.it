<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>OTHING is esteemed
a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than
the lowness of interest: And with reason; though I believe the
cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended.
Lowness of interest is generally ascribed to plenty of money. But
money, however plentiful, has no other effect, <em>if fixed</em>,
than to raise the price of labour. Silver is more common than gold;
and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same
commodities. But do you pay less interest for it? Interest in
Batavia and Jamaica is at 10 per cent. in Portugal at 6; though
these places, as we may learn from the prices of every thing,
abound more in gold and silver than either London or Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Were all the gold in England annihilated at once, and one and
twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea, would
money be more plentiful or interest lower? No surely: We should
only use silver instead of gold. Were gold rendered as common as
silver, and silver as common as copper; would money be more
plentiful or interest lower? We may assuredly give the same answer.
Our shillings would then be yellow, and our halfpence white; and we
should have no guineas. No other difference would ever be observed;
no alteration on commerce, manufactures, navigation, or interest;
unless we imagine, that the colour of the metal is of any
consequence.</p>
<p>Now, what is so visible in these greater variations of scarcity
or abundance in the precious metals, must hold in all inferior
changes. If the multiplying of gold and silver fifteen times makes
no difference, much less can the doubling or tripling them. All
augmentation has no other effect than to heighten the price of
labour and commodities; and even this variation is little more than
that of a name. In the progress towards these changes, the
augmentation may have some influence, by exciting industry; but
after the prices are settled, suitably to the new abundance of gold
and silver, it has no manner of influence.</p>
<p>An effect always holds proportion with its cause. Prices have
risen near four times since the discovery of the Indies; and it is
probable gold and silver have multiplied much more: But interest
has not fallen much above half. The rate of interest, therefore, is
not derived from the quantity of the precious metals.</p>
<p>Money having chiefly a fictitious value, the greater or less
plenty of it is of no consequence, if we consider a nation within
itself; and the quantity of specie, when once fixed, though ever so
large, has no other effect, than to oblige every one to tell out a
greater number of those shining bits of metal, for clothes,
furniture or equipage, without encreasing any one convenience of
life. If a man borrow money to build a house, he then carries home
a greater load; because the stone, timber, lead, glass, &amp;c.
with the labour of the masons and carpenters, are represented by a
greater quantity of gold and silver. But as these metals are
considered chiefly as representations, there can no alteration
arise, from their bulk or quantity, their weight or colour, either
upon their real value or their interest. The same interest, in all
cases, bears the same proportion to the sum. And if you lent me so
much labour and so many commodities; by receiving five per cent.
you always receive proportional labour and commodities, however
represented, whether by yellow or white coin, whether by a pound or
an ounce. It is in vain, therefore, to look for the cause of the
fall or rise of interest in the greater or less quantity of gold
and silver, which is fixed in any nation.</p>
<p>High interest arises from <em>three</em> circumstances: A great
demand for borrowing; little riches to supply that demand; and
great profits arising from commerce: And these circumstances are a
clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry, not of
the scarcity of gold and silver. Low interest, on the other hand,
proceeds from the three opposite circumstances: A small demand for
borrowing; great riches to supply that demand; and small profits
arising from commerce: And these circumstances are all connected
together, and proceed from the encrease of industry and commerce,
not of gold and silver. We shall endeavour to prove these points;
and shall begin with the causes and the effects of a great or small
demand for borrowing.</p>
<p>When a people have emerged ever so little from a savage state,
and their numbers have encreased beyond the original multitude,
there must immediately arise an inequality of property; and while
some possess large tracts of land, others are confined within
narrow limits, and some are entirely without any <em>landed</em>
property. Those who possess more land than they can labour, employ
those who possess none, and agree to receive a determinate part of
the product. Thus the landed interest is immediately established;
nor is there any settled government, however rude, in which affairs
are not on this footing. Of these proprietors of land, some must
presently discover themselves to be of different tempers from
others; and while one would willingly store up the produce of his
land for futurity, another desires to consume at present what
should suffice for many years. But as the spending of a settled
revenue is a way of life entirely without occupation; men have so
much need of somewhat to fix and engage them, that pleasures, such
as they are, will be the pursuit of the greater part of the
landholders, and the prodigals among them will always be more
numerous than the misers. In a state, therefore, where there is
nothing but a landed interest, as there is little frugality, the
borrowers must be very numerous, and the rate of interest must hold
proportion to it. The difference depends not on the quantity of
money, but on the habits and manners which prevail. By this alone
the demand for borrowing is encreased or diminished. Were money so
plentiful as to make an egg be sold for sixpence; so long as there
are only landed gentry and peasants in the state, the borrowers
must be numerous, and interest high. The rent for the same farm
would be heavier and more bulky: But the same idleness of the
landlord, with the higher price of commodities, would dissipate it
in the same time, and produce the same necessity and demand for
borrowing.</p>
<p>Nor is the case different with regard to the <em>second</em>
circumstance which we proposed to consider, namely, the great or
little riches to supply the demand. This effect also depends on the
habits and way of living of the people, not on the quantity of gold
and silver. In order to have, in any state, a great number of
lenders, it is not sufficient nor requisite, that there be great
abundance of the precious metals. It is only requisite, that the
property or command of that quantity, which is in the state,
whether great or small, should be collected in particular hands, so
as to form considerable sums, or compose a great monied interest.
This begets a number of lenders, and sinks the rate of usury; and
this I shall venture to affirm, depends not on the quantity of
specie, but on particular manners and customs, which make the
specie gather into separate sums or masses of considerable
value.</p>
<p>For suppose, that, by miracle, every man in Great Britain should
have five pounds slipt into his pocket in one night; this would
much more than double the whole money that is at present in the
kingdom; yet there would not next day, nor for some time, be any
more lenders, nor any variation in the interest. And were there
nothing but landlords and peasants in the state, this money,
however abundant, could never gather into sums; and would only
serve to encrease the prices of every thing, without any farther
consequence. The prodigal landlord dissipates it, as fast as he
receives it; and the beggarly peasant has no means, nor view, nor
ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood. The overplus of
borrowers above that of lenders continuing still the same, there
will follow no reduction of interest. That depends upon another
principle; and must proceed from an encrease of industry and
frugality, of arts and commerce.</p>
<p>Every thing useful to the life of man arises from the ground;
but few things arise in that condition which is requisite to render
them useful. There must, therefore, beside the peasants and the
proprietors of land, be another rank of men, who receiving from the
former the rude materials, work them into their proper form, and
retain part for their own use and subsistence. In the infancy of
society, these contracts between the artisans and the peasants, and
between one species of artisans and another are commonly entered
into immediately by the persons themselves, who, being neighbours,
are easily acquainted with each other’s necessities, and can lend
their mutual assistance to supply them. But when men’s industry
encreases, and their views enlarge, it is found, that the most
remote parts of the state can assist each other as well as the more
contiguous, and that this intercourse of good offices may be
carried on to the greatest extent and intricacy. Hence the origin
of <em>merchants</em>, one of the most useful races of men, who
serve as agents between those parts of the state, that are wholly
unacquainted, and are ignorant of each other’s necessities. Here
are in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen, and a thousand
customers; and these two ranks of men, so necessary to each other,
can never rightly meet, till one man erects a shop, to which all
the workmen and all the customers repair. In this province, grass
rises in abundance: The inhabitants abound in cheese, and butter,
and cattle; but want bread and corn, which, in a neighbouring
province, are in too great abundance for the use of the
inhabitants. One man discovers this. He brings corn from the one
province and returns with cattle; and supplying the wants of both,
he is, so far, a common benefactor. As the people encrease in
numbers and industry, the difficulty of their intercourse
encreases: The business of the agency or merchandize becomes more
intricate; and divides, subdivides, compounds, and mixes to a
greater variety. In all these transactions, it is necessary, and
reasonable, that a considerable part of the commodities and labour
should belong to the merchant, to whom, in a great measure, they
are owing. And these commodities he will sometimes preserve in
kind, or more commonly convert into money, which is their common
representation. If gold and silver have encreased in the state
together with the industry, it will require a great quantity of
these metals to represent a great quantity of commodities and
labour. If industry alone has encreased, the prices of every thing
must sink, and a small quantity of specie will serve as a
representation.</p>
<p>There is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant
and insatiable than that for exercise and employment; and this
desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits.
Deprive a man of all business and serious occupation, he runs
restless from one amusement to another; and the weight and
oppression, which he feels from idleness, is so great, that he
forgets the ruin which must follow him from his immoderate
expences. Give him a more harmless way of employing his mind or
body, he is satisfied, and feels no longer that insatiable thirst
after pleasure. But if the employment you give him be lucrative,
especially if the profit be attached to every particular exertion
of industry, he has gain so often in his eye, that he acquires, by
degrees, a passion for it, and knows no such pleasure as that of
seeing the daily encrease of his fortune. And this is the reason
why trade encreases frugality, and why, among merchants, there is
the same overplus of misers above prodigals, as, among the
possessors of land, there is the contrary.</p>
<p>Commerce encreases industry, by conveying it readily from one
member of the state to another, and allowing none of it to perish
or become useless. It encreases frugality, by giving occupation to
men, and employing them in the arts of gain, which soon engage
their affection, and remove all relish for pleasure and expence. It
is an infallible consequence of all industrious professions, to
beget frugality, and make the love of gain prevail over the love of
pleasure. Among lawyers and physicians who have any practice, there
are many more who live within their income, than who exceed it, or
even live up to it. But lawyers and physicians beget no industry;
and it is even at the expence of others they acquire their riches;
so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their
fellow-citizens, as fast as they encrease their own. Merchants, on
the contrary, beget industry, by serving as canals to convey it
through every corner of the state: And at the same time, by their
frugality, they acquire great power over that industry, and collect
a large property in the labour and commodities, which they are the
chief instruments in producing. There is no other profession,
therefore, except merchandize, which can make the monied interest
considerable, or, in other words, can encrease industry, and, by
also encreasing frugality, give a great command of that industry to
particular members of the society. Without commerce, the state must
consist chiefly of landed gentry, whose prodigality and expence
make a continual demand for borrowing; and of peasants, who have no
sums to supply that demand. The money never gathers into large
stocks or sums, which can be lent at interest. It is dispersed into
numberless hands, who either squander it in idle show and
magnificence, or employ it in the purchase of the common
necessaries of life. Commerce alone assembles it into considerable
sums; and this effect it has merely from the industry which it
begets, and the frugality which it inspires, independent of that
particular quantity of precious metal which may circulate in the
state.</p>
<p>Thus an encrease of commerce, by a necessary consequence, raises
a great number of lenders, and by that means produces lowness of
interest. We must now consider how far this encrease of commerce
diminishes the profits arising from that profession, and gives rise
to the third circumstance requisite to produce lowness of
interest.</p>
<p>It may be proper to observe on this head, that low interest and
low profits of merchandize are two events, that mutually forward
each other, and are both originally derived from that extensive
commerce, which produces opulent merchants, and renders the monied
interest considerable. Where merchants possess great stocks,
whether represented by few or many pieces of metal, it must
frequently happen, that, when they either become tired of business,
or leave heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce, a great
proportion of these riches naturally seeks an annual and secure
revenue. The plenty diminishes the price, and makes the lenders
accept of a low interest. This consideration obliges many to keep
their stock employed in trade, and rather be content with low
profits than dispose of their money at an under-value. On the other
hand, when commerce has become extensive, and employs large stocks,
there must arise rivalships among the merchants, which diminish the
profits of trade, at the same time that they encrease the trade
itself. The low profits of merchandize induce the merchants to
accept more willingly of a low interest, when they leave off
business, and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence. It
is needless, therefore, to enquire which of these circumstances, to
wit, <em>low interest or low profits</em>, is the cause, and which
the effect? They both arise from an extensive commerce, and
mutually forward each other. No man will accept of low profits,
where he can have high interest; and no man will accept of low
interest, where he can have high profits. An extensive commerce, by
producing large stocks, diminishes both interest and profits; and
is always assisted, in its diminution of the one, by the
proportional sinking of the other. I may add, that, as low profits
arise from the encrease of commerce and industry, they serve in
their turn to its farther encrease, by rendering the commodities
cheaper, encouraging the consumption, and heightening the industry.
And thus, if we consider the whole connexion of causes and effects,
interest is the barometer of the state, and its lowness is a sign
almost infallible of the flourishing condition of a people. It
proves the encrease of industry, and its prompt circulation through
the whole state, little inferior to a demonstration. And though,
perhaps, it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to
commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind, by throwing
so many stocks out of trade; it must be attended with such misery
and want of employment in the poor, that, besides its short
duration, it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the
other.</p>
<p>Those who have asserted, that the plenty of money was the cause
of low interest, seem to have taken a collateral effect for a
cause; since the same industry, which sinks the interest, commonly
acquires great abundance of the precious metals. A variety of fine
manufactures, with vigilant enterprising merchants, will soon draw
money to a state, if it be any where to be found in the world. The
same cause, by multiplying the conveniencies of life, and
encreasing industry, collects great riches into the hands of
persons, who are not proprietors of land, and produces, by that
means, a lowness of interest. But though both these effects, plenty
of money and low interest, naturally arise from commerce and
industry, they are altogether independent of each other. For
suppose a nation removed into the <em>Pacific</em> ocean, without
any foreign commerce, or any knowledge of navigation: Suppose, that
this nation possesses always the same stock of coin, but is
continually encreasing in its numbers and industry: It is evident,
that the price of every commodity must gradually diminish in that
kingdom; since it is the proportion between money and any species
of goods, which fixes their mutual value; and, upon the present
supposition, the conveniencies of life become every day more
abundant, without any alteration in the current specie. A less
quantity of money, therefore, among this people, will make a rich
man, during the times of industry, than would suffice to that
purpose, in ignorant and slothful ages. Less money will build a
house, portion a daughter, buy an estate, support a manufactory, or
maintain a family and equipage. These are the uses for which men
borrow money; and therefore, the greater or less quantity of it in
a state has no influence on the interest. But it is evident, that
the greater or less stock of labour and commodities must have a
great influence; since we really and in effect borrow these, when
we take money upon interest. It is true, when commerce is extended
all over the globe, the most industrious nations always abound most
with the precious metals: So that low interest and plenty of money
are in fact almost inseparable. But still it is of consequence to
know the principle whence any phenomenon arises, and to distinguish
between a cause and a concomitant effect. Besides that the
speculation is curious, it may frequently be of use in the conduct
of public affairs. At least, it must be owned, that nothing can be
of more use than to improve, by practice, the method of reasoning
on these subjects, which of all others are the most important;
though they are commonly treated in the loosest and most careless
manner.</p>
<p>Another reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause
of low interest, seems to be the instance of some nations; where,
after a sudden acquisition of money or of the precious metals, by
means of foreign conquest, the interest has fallen, not only among
them, but in all the neighbouring states, as soon as that money was
dispersed, and had insinuated itself into every corner. Thus,
interest in Spain fell near a half immediately after the discovery
of the West Indies, as we are informed by Garcilasso de la Vega:
And it has been ever since gradually sinking in every kingdom of
Europe. Interest in Rome, after the conquest of Egypt, fell from 6
to 4 per cent. as we learn from Dion.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_13" id="footnote_13_call">[13]</a></p>
<p>The causes of the sinking of interest, upon such an event, seem
different in the conquering country and in the neighbouring states;
but in neither of them can we justly ascribe that effect merely to
the encrease of gold and silver.</p>
<p>In the conquering country, it is natural to imagine, that this
new acquisition of money will fall into a few hands, and be
gathered into large sums, which seek a secure revenue, either by
the purchase of land or by interest; and consequently the same
effect follows, for a little time, as if there had been a great
accession of industry and commerce. The encrease of lenders above
the borrowers sinks the interest; and so much the faster, if those,
who have acquired those large sums, find no industry or commerce in
the state, and no method of employing their money but by lending it
at interest. But after this new mass of gold and silver has been
digested, and has circulated through the whole state, affairs will
soon return to their former situation; while the landlords and new
money-holders, living idly, squander above their income; and the
former daily contract debt, and the latter encroach on their stock
till its final extinction. The whole money may still be in the
state, and make itself felt by the encrease of prices: But not
being now collected into any large masses or stocks, the
disproportion between the borrowers and lenders is the same as
formerly, and consequently the high interest returns.</p>
<p>Accordingly we find, in Rome, that, so early as Tiberius’s time,
interest had again mounted to 6 per cent.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_14" id="footnote_14_call">[14]</a> though
no accident had happened to drain the empire of money. In Trajan’s
time, money lent on mortgages in Italy, bore 6 per cent.;<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_15" id=
"footnote_15_call">[15]</a> on common securities in Bithynia,
12.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_16" id=
"footnote_16_call">[16]</a> And if interest in Spain has not risen
to its old pitch; this can be ascribed to nothing but the
continuance of the same cause that sunk it, to wit, the large
fortunes continually made in the Indies, which come over to Spain
from time to time, and supply the demand of the borrowers. By this
accidental and extraneous cause, more money is to be lent in Spain,
that is, more money is collected into large sums than would
otherwise be found in a state, where there are so little commerce
and industry.</p>
<p>As to the reduction of interest, which has followed in England,
France, and other kingdoms of Europe, that have no mines, it has
been gradual; and has not proceeded from the encrease of money,
considered merely in itself; but from that of industry, which is
the natural effect of the former encrease, in that interval, before
it raises the price of labour and provisions. For to return to the
foregoing supposition; if the industry of England had risen as much
from other causes, (and that rise might easily have happened,
though the stock of money had remained the same) must not all the
same consequences have followed, which we observe at present? The
same people would, in that case, be found in the kingdom, the same
commodities, the same industry, manufactures, and commerce; and
consequently the same merchants, with the same stocks, that is,
with the same command over labour and commodities, only represented
by a smaller number of white or yellow pieces; which being a
circumstance of no moment, would only affect the waggoner, porter,
and trunk-maker. Luxury, therefore, manufactures, arts, industry,
frugality, flourishing equally as at present, it is evident, that
interest must also have been as low; since that is the necessary
result of all these circumstances; so far as they determine the
profits of commerce, and the proportion between the borrowers and
lenders in any state.</p>
