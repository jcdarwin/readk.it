<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring dinner, Mr.
Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn,
he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and
therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by
observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration
for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not
have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The
subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and
with a most important aspect he protested that "he had never in his
life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability
and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady
Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of
the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching
before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and
had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;had never seen anything
but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to
any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his
joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the
parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She
had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could,
provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in
his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the
alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest
some herself—some shelves in the closet upstairs."</p>
<p>"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity
that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live
near you, sir?"</p>
<p>"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by
a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."</p>
<p>"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"</p>
<p>"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better
off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she
handsome?"</p>
<p>"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine
herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far
superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her
features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is
unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her
from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could
not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who
superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But
she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my
humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."</p>
<p>"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the
ladies at court."</p>
<p>"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in
town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has
deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments. Her ladyship
seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy
on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which
are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to
Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a
duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her
consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little
things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention
which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."</p>
<p>"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for
you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I
ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of
the moment, or are the result of previous study?"</p>
<p>"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though
I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little
elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I
always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as
absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest
enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure
of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth,
requiring no partner in his pleasure.</p>
<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet
was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when
tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.
Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on
beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating
library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he
never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other
books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's
Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had,
with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted
him with:</p>
<p>"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning
away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My
aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton
to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes
back from town."</p>
<p>Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but
Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:</p>
<p>"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by
books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.
It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so
advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune
my young cousin."</p>
<p>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist
at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he
acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling
amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly
for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur
again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring
them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never
resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another
table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.</p>
