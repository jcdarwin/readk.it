<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t is a truth
universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good
fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed
in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the
rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you
heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
<p>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here,
and she told me all about it."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
<p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife
impatiently.</p>
<p>"<em>You</em>&#160;want to tell me, and I have no objection to
hearing it."</p>
<p>This was invitation enough.</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is
taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;
that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place,
and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris
immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and
some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next
week."</p>
<p>"What is his name?"</p>
<p>"Bingley."</p>
<p>"Is he married or single?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;
four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</p>
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?"</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so
tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of
them."</p>
<p>"Is that his design in settling here?"</p>
<p>"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely
that he&#160;<em>may</em>&#160;fall in love with one of them, and
therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."</p>
<p>"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you
may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better,
for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you
the best of the party."</p>
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I
certainly&#160;<em>have</em>&#160;had my share of beauty, but I do
not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."</p>
<p>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think
of."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he
comes into the neighbourhood."</p>
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."</p>
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment
it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are
determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know,
they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
impossible for&#160;<em>us</em>&#160;to visit him if you do
not."</p>
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be
very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure
him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of
the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little
Lizzy."</p>
<p>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better
than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane,
nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always
giving&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;the preference."</p>
<p>"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he;
"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has
something more of quickness than her sisters."</p>
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how&#160;<em>can</em>&#160;you abuse your own
children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no
compassion for my poor nerves."</p>
<p>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.
They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with
consideration these last twenty years at least."</p>
<p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."</p>
<p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men
of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."</p>
<p>"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you
will not visit them."</p>
<p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will
visit them all."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic
humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of
three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife
understand his character.&#160;<em>Her</em>&#160;mind was less
difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little
information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</p>
