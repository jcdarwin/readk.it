<p>I had come at last, in the course of this rambling, to the
shelves which hold books by the living; by women and by men; for
there are almost as many books written by women now as by men. Or
if that is not yet quite true, if the male is still the voluble
sex, it is certainly true that women no longer write novels solely.
There are Jane Harrison's books on Greek archaeology; Vernon Lee's
books on aesthetics; Gertrude Bell's books on Persia. There are
books on all sorts of subjects which a generation ago no woman
could have touched. There are poems and plays and criticism; there
are histories and biographies, books of travel and books of
scholarship and research; there are even a few philosophies and
books about science and economics. And though novels predominate,
novels themselves may very well have changed from association with
books of a different feather. The natural simplicity, the epic age
of women's writing, may have gone. Reading and criticism may have
given her a wider range, a greater subtlety. The impulse towards
autobiography may be spent. She may be beginning to use writing as
an art, not as a method of selfexpression. Among these new novels
one might find an answer to several such questions.</p>
<p>I took down one of them at random. It stood at the very end of
the shelf, was called LIFE'S ADVENTURE, or some such title, by Mary
Carmichael, and was published in this very month of October. It
seems to be her first book, I said to myself, but one must read it
as if it were the last volume in a fairly long series, continuing
all those other books that I have been glancing at—Lady
Winchilsea's poems and Aphra Behn's plays and the novels of the
four great novelists. For books continue each other, in spite of
our habit of judging them separately. And I must also consider
her—this unknown woman—as the descendant of all those other women
whose circumstances I have been glancing at and see what she
inherits of their characteristics and restrictions. So, with a
sigh, because novels so often provide an anodyne and not an
antidote, glide one into torpid slumbers instead of rousing one
with a burning brand, I settled down with a notebook and a pencil
to make what I could of Mary Carmichael's first novel, LIFE'S
ADVENTURE.</p>
<p>To begin with, I ran my eye up and down the page. I am going to
get the hang of her sentences first, I said, before I load my
memory with blue eyes and brown and the relationship that there may
be between Chloe and Roger. There will be time for that when I have
decided whether she has a pen in her hand or a pickaxe. So I tried
a sentence or two on my tongue. Soon it was obvious that something
was not quite in order. The smooth gliding of sentence after
sentence was interrupted. Something tore, something scratched; a
single word here and there flashed its torch in my eyes. She was
'unhanding' herself as they say in the old plays. She is like a
person striking a match that will not light, I thought. But why, I
asked her as if she were present, are Jane Austen's sentences not
of the right shape for you? Must they all be scrapped because Emma
and Mr Woodhouse are dead? Alas, I sighed, that it should be so.
For while Jane Austen breaks from melody to melody as Mozart from
song to song, to read this writing was like being out at sea in an
open boat. Up one went, down one sank. This terseness, this
short-windedness, might mean that she was afraid of something;
afraid of being called 'sentimental' perhaps; or she remembers that
women's writing has been called flowery and so provides a
superfluity of thorns; but until I have read a scene with some
care, I cannot be surewhether she is being herself or someone else.
At any rate, she does not lower one's vitality, I thought, reading
more carefully. But she is heaping up too many facts. She will not
be able to use half of them in a book of this size. (It was about
half the length of JANE EYRE.) However, by some means or other she
succeeded in getting us all—Roger, Chloe, Olivia, Tony and Mr
Bigham—in a canoe up the river. Wait a moment, I said, leaning back
in my chair, I must consider the whole thing more carefully before
I go any further.</p>
<p>I am almost sure, I said to myself, that Mary Carmichael is
playing a trick on us. For I feel as one feels on a switchback
railway when the car, instead of sinking, as one has been led to
expect, swerves up again. Mary is tampering with the expected
sequence. First she broke the sentence; now she has broken the
sequence. Very well, she has every right to do both these things if
she does them not for the sake of breaking, but for the sake of
creating. Which of the two it is I cannot be sure until she has
faced herself with a situation. I will give her every liberty, I
said, to choose what that situation shall be; she shall make it of
tin cans and old kettles if she likes; but she must convince me
that she believes it to be a situation; and then when she has made
it she must face it. She must jump. And, determined to do my duty
by her as reader if she would do her duty by me as writer, I turned
the page and read… I am sorry to break off so abruptly. Are there
no men present? Do you promise me that behind that red curtain over
there the figure of Sir Charles Biron is not concealed? We are all
women you assure me? Then I may tell you that the very next words I
read were these—'Chloe liked Olivia… ' Do not start. Do not blush.
Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things
sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women.</p>
<p>'Chloe liked Olivia,' I read. And then it struck me how immense
a change was there. Chloe liked Olivia perhaps for the first time
in literature. Cleopatra did not like Octavia. And how completely
ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA would have been altered had she done so! As it
is, I thought, letting my mind, I am afraid, wander a little from
LIFE'S ADVENTURE, the whole thing is simplified, conventionalized,
if one dared say it, absurdly. Cleopatra's only feeling about
Octavia is one of jealousy. Is she taller than I am? How does she
do her hair? The play, perhaps, required no more. But how
interesting it would have been if the relationship between the two
women had been more complicated. All these relationships between
women, I thought, rapidly recalling the splendid gallery of
fictitious women, are too simple. So much has been left out,
unattempted. And I tried to remember any case in the course of my
reading where two women are represented as friends. There is an
attempt at it in DIANA OF THE CROSSWAYS. They are confidantes, of
course, in Racine and the Greek tragedies. They are now and then
mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown
in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the
great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen's day, not only seen
by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And
how small a part of a woman's life is that; and how little can a
man know even of that when he observes it through the black or rosy
spectacles which sex puts upon his nose. Hence, perhaps, the
peculiar nature of woman in fiction; the astonishing extremes of
her beauty and horror; her alternations between heavenly goodness
and hellish depravity—for so a lover would see her as his love rose
or sank, was prosperous or unhappy. This is not so true of the
nineteenth-century novelists, of course. Woman becomes much more
various and complicated there. Indeed it was the desire to write
about women perhaps that led men by degrees to abandon the poetic
drama which, with its violence, could make so little use of them,
and to devise the novel as a more fitting receptacle. Even so it
remains obvious, even in the writing of Proust, that a man is
terribly hampered and partial in his knowledge of women, as a woman
in her knowledge of men.</p>
<p>Also, I continued, looking down at the page again, it is
becoming evident that women, like men, have other interests besides
the perennial interests of domesticity. 'Chloe liked Olivia. They
shared a laboratory together… ' I read on and discovered that these
two young women were engaged in mincing liver, which is, it seems,
a cure for pernicious anaemia; although one of them was married and
had—I think I am right in stating—two small children. Now all that,
of course, has had to be left out, and thus the splendid portrait
of the fictitious woman is much too simple and much too monotonous.
Suppose, for instance, that men were only represented in literature
as the lovers of women, and were never the friends of men,
soldiers, thinkers, dreamers; how few parts in the plays of
Shakespeare could be allotted to them; how literature would suffer!
We might perhaps have most of Othello; and a good deal of Antony;
but no Caesar, no Brutus, no Hamlet, no Lear, no Jaques—literature
would be incredibly impoverished, as indeed literature is
impoverished beyond our counting by the doors that have been shut
upon women. Married against their will, kept in one room, and to
one occupation, how could a dramatist give a full or interesting or
truthful account of them? Love was the only possible interpreter.
The poet was forced to be passionate or bitter, unless indeed he
chose to 'hate women', which meant more often than not that he was
unattractive to them.</p>
<p>Now if Chloe likes Olivia and they share a laboratory, which of
itself will make their friendship more varied and lasting because
it will be less personal; if Mary Carmichael knows how to write,
and I was beginning to enjoy some quality in her style; if she has
a room to herself, of which I am not quite sure; if she has five
hundred a year of her own—but that remains to be proved—then I
think that something of great importance has happened.</p>
<p>For if Chloe likes Olivia and Mary Carmichael knows how to
express it she will light a torch in that vast chamber where nobody
has yet been. It is all half lights and profound shadows like those
serpentine caves where one goes with a candle peering up and down,
not knowing where one is stepping. And I began to read the book
again, and read how Chloe watched Olivia put a jar on a shelf and
say how it was time to go home to her children. That is a sight
that has never been seen since the world began, I exclaimed. And I
watched too, very curiously. For I wanted to see how Mary
Carmichael set to work to catch those unrecorded gestures, those
unsaid or half-said words, which form themselves, no more palpably
than the shadows of moths on the ceiling, when women are alone,
unlit by the capricious and coloured light of the other sex. She
will need to hold her breath, I said, reading on, if she is to do
it; for women are so suspicious of any interest that has not some
obvious motive behind it, so terribly accustomed to concealment and
suppression, that they are off at the flicker of an eye turned
observingly in their direction. The only way for you to do it, I
thought, addressing Mary Carmichael as if she were there, would be
to talk of something else, looking steadily out of the window, and
thus note, not with a pencil in a notebook, but in the shortest of
shorthand, in words that are hardly syllabled yet, what happens
when Olivia—this organism that has been under the shadow of the
rock these million years—feels the light fall on it, and sees
coming her way a piece of strange food—knowledge, adventure, art.
And she reaches out for it, I thought, again raising my eyes from
the page, and has to devise some entirely new combination of her
resources, so highly developed for other purposes, so as to absorb
the new into the old without disturbing the infinitely intricate
and elaborate balance of the whole.</p>
<p>But, alas, I had done what I had determined not to do; I had
slipped unthinkingly into praise of my own sex. 'Highly
developed'—'infinitely intricate'—such are undeniably terms of
praise, and to praise one's own sex is always suspect, often silly;
moreover, in this case, how could one justify it? One could not go
to the map and say Columbus discovered America and Columbus was a
woman; or take an apple and remark, Newton discovered the laws of
gravitation and Newton was a woman; or look into the sky and say
aeroplanes are flying overhead and aeroplanes were invented by
women. There is no mark on the wall to measure the precise height
of women. There are no yard measures, neatly divided into the
fractions of an inch, that one can lay against the qualities of a
good mother or the devotion of a daughter, or the fidelity of a
sister, or the capacity of a housekeeper. Few women even now have
been graded at the universities; the great trials of the
professions, army and navy, trade, politics and diplomacy have
hardly tested them. They remain even at this moment almost
unclassified. But if I want to know all that a human being can tell
me about Sir Hawley Butts, for instance, I have only to open Burke
or Debrett and I shall find that he took such and such a degree;
owns a hall; has an heir; was Secretary to a Board; represented
Great Britain in Canada; and has received a certain number of
degrees, offices, medals and other distinctions by which his merits
are stamped upon him indelibly. Only Providence can know more about
Sir Hawley Butts than that.</p>
<p>When, therefore, I say 'highly developed', 'infinitely
intricate' of women, I am unable to verify my words either in
Whitaker, Debrett or the University Calendar. In this predicament
what can I do? And I looked at the bookcase again. There were the
biographies: Johnson and Goethe and Carlyle and Sterne and Cowper
and Shelley and Voltaire and Browning and many others. And I began
thinking of all those great men who have for one reason or another
admired, sought out, lived with, confided in, made love to, written
of, trusted in, and shown what can only be described as some need
of and dependence upon certain persons of the opposite sex. That
all these relationships were absolutely Platonic I would not
affirm, and Sir William Joynson Hicks would probably deny. But we
should wrong these illustrious men very greatly if we insisted that
they got nothing from these alliances but comfort, flattery and the
pleasures of the body. What they got, it is obvious, was something
that their own sex was unable to supply; and it would not be rash,
perhaps, to define it further, without quoting the doubtless
rhapsodical words of the poets, as some stimulus; some renewal of
creative power which is in the gift only of the opposite sex to
bestow. He would open the door of drawing-room or nursery, I
thought, and find her among her children perhaps, or with a piece
of embroidery on her knee—at any rate, the centre of some different
order and system of life, and the contrast between this world and
his own, which might be the law courts or the House of Commons,
would at once refresh and invigorate; and there would follow, even
in the simplest talk, such a natural difference of opinion that the
dried ideas in him would be fertilized anew; and the sight of her
creating in a different medium from his own would so quicken his
creative power that insensibly his sterile mind would begin to plot
again, and he would find the phrase or the scene which was lacking
when he put on his hat to visit her. Every Johnson has his Thrale,
and holds fast to her for some such reasons as these, and when the
Thrale marries her Italian music master Johnson goes half mad with
rage and disgust, not merely that he will miss his pleasant
evenings at Streatham, but that the light of his life will be 'as
if gone out'.</p>
<p>And without being Dr Johnson or Goethe or Carlyle or Voltaire,
one may feel, though very differently from these great men, the
nature of this intricacy and the power of this highly developed
creative faculty among women. One goes into the room—but the
resources of the English language would he much put to the stretch,
and whole flights of words would need to wing their way
illegitimately into existence before a woman could say what happens
when she goes into a room. The rooms differ so completely; they are
calm or thunderous; open on to the sea, or, on the contrary, give
on to a prison yard; are hung with washing; or alive with opals and
silks; are hard as horsehair or soft as feathers—one has only to go
into any room in any street for the whole of that extremely complex
force of femininity to fly in one's face. How should it be
otherwise? For women have sat indoors all these millions of years,
so that by this time the very walls are permeated by their creative
force, which has, indeed, so overcharged the capacity of bricks and
mortar that it must needs harness itself to pens and brushes and
business and politics. But this creative power differs greatly from
the creative power of men. And one must conclude that it would be a
thousand pities if it were hindered or wasted, for it was won by
centuries of the most drastic discipline, and there is nothing to
take its place. It would be a thousand pities if women wrote like
men, or lived like men, or looked like men, for if two sexes are
quite inadequate, considering the vastness and variety of the
world, how should we manage with one only? Ought not education to
bring out and fortify the differences rather than the similarities?
For we have too much likeness as it is, and if an explorer should
come back and bring word of other sexes looking through the
branches of other trees at other skies, nothing would he of greater
service to humanity; and we should have the immense pleasure into
the bargain of watching Professor X rush for his measuring-rods to
prove himself 'superior'.</p>
<p>Mary Carmichael, I thought, still hovering at a little distance
above the page, will have her work cut out for her merely as an
observer. I am afraid indeed that she will be tempted to become,
what I think the less interesting branch of the species—the
naturalist-novelist, and not the contemplative. There are so many
new facts for her to observe. She will not need to limit herself
any longer to the respectable houses of the upper middle classes.
She will go without kindness or condescension, but in the spirit of
fellowship, into those small, scented rooms where sit the
courtesan, the harlot and the lady with the pug dog. There they
still sit in the rough and ready-made clothes that the male writer
has had perforce to clap upon their shoulders. But Mary Carmichael
will have out her scissors and fit them close to every hollow and
angle. It will be a curious sight, when it comes, to see these
women as they are, but we must wait a little, for Mary Carmichael
will still be encumbered with that self-consciousness in the
presence of 'sin' which is the legacy of our sexual barbarity. She
will still wear the shoddy old fetters of class on her feet.</p>
<p>However, the majority of women are neither harlots nor
courtesans; nor do they sit clasping pug dogs to dusty velvet all
through the summer afternoon. But what do they do then? and there
came to my mind's eye one of those long streets somewhere south of
the river whose infinite rows are innumerably populated. With the
eye of the imagination I saw a very ancient lady crossing the
street on the arm of a middle-aged woman, her daughter, perhaps,
both so respectably booted and furred that their dressing in the
afternoon must be a ritual, and the clothes themselves put away in
cupboards with camphor, year after year, throughout the summer
months. They cross the road when the lamps are being lit (for the
dusk is their favourite hour), as they must have done year after
year. The elder is close on eighty; but if one asked her what her
life has meant to her, she would say that she remembered the
streets lit for the battle of Balaclava, or had heard the guns fire
in Hyde Park for the birth of King Edward the Seventh. And if one
asked her, longing to pin down the moment with date and season, but
what were you doing on the fifth of April 1868, or the second of
November 1875, she would look vague and say that she could remember
nothing. For all the dinners are cooked; the plates and cups
washed; the children sent to school and gone out into the world.
Nothing remains of it all. All has vanished. No biography or
history has a word to say about it. And the novels, without meaning
to, inevitably lie.</p>
<p>All these infinitely obscure lives remain to be recorded, I
said, addressing Mary Carmichael as if she were present; and went
on in thought through the streets of London feeling in imagination
the pressure of dumbness, the accumulation of unrecorded life,
whether from the women at the street corners with their arms
akimbo, and the rings embedded in their fat swollen fingers,
talking with a gesticulation like the swing of Shakespeare's words;
or from the violet-sellers and match-sellers and old crones
stationed under doorways; or from drifting girls whose faces, like
waves in sun and cloud, signal the coming of men and women and the
flickering lights of shop windows. All that you will have to
explore, I said to Mary Carmichael, holding your torch firm in your
hand. Above all, you must illumine your own soul with its
profundities and its shallows, and its vanities and its
generosities, and say what your beauty means to you or your
plainness, and what is your relation to the everchanging and
turning world of gloves and shoes and stuffs swaying up and down
among the faint scents that come through chemists' bottles down
arcades of dress material over a floor of pseudo-marble. For in
imagination I had gone into a shop; it was laid with black and
white paving; it was hung, astonishingly beautifully, with coloured
ribbons. Mary Carmichael might well have a look at that in passing,
I thought, for it is a sight that would lend itself to the pen as
fittingly as any snowy peak or rocky gorge in the Andes. And there
is the girl behind the counter too—I would as soon have her true
history as the hundred and fiftieth life of Napoleon or seventieth
study of Keats and his use of Miltonic inversion which old
Professor Z and his like are now inditing. And then I went on very
warily, on the very tips of my toes (so cowardly am I, so afraid of
the lash that was once almost laid on my own shoulders), to murmur
that she should also learn to laugh, without bitterness, at the
vanities—say rather at the peculiarities, for it is a less
offensive word—of the other sex. For there is a spot the size of a
shilling at the back of the head which one can never see for
oneself. It is one of the good offices that sex can discharge for
sex—to describe that spot the size of a shilling at the back of the
head. Think how much women have profited by the comments of
Juvenal; by the criticism of Strindberg. Think with what humanity
and brilliancy men, from the earliest ages, have pointed out to
women that dark place at the back of the head! And if Mary were
very brave and very honest, she would go behind the other sex and
tell us what she found there. A true picture of man as a whole can
never be painted until a woman has described that spot the size of
a shilling. Mr Woodhouse and Mr Casuabon are spots of that size and
nature. Not of course that anyone in their senses would counsel her
to hold up to scorn and ridicule of set purpose—literature shows
the futility of what is written in that spirit. Be truthful, one
would say, and the result is bound to be amazingly interesting.
Comedy is bound to be enriched. New facts are bound to be
discovered.</p>
<p>However, it was high time to lower my eyes to the page again. It
would be better, instead of speculating what Mary Carmichael might
write and should write, to see what in fact Mary Carmichael did
write. So I began to read again. I remembered that I had certain
grievances against her. She had broken up Jane Austen's sentence,
and thus given me no chance of pluming myself upon my impeccable
taste, my fastidious ear. For it was useless to say, 'Yes, yes,
this is very nice; but Jane Austen wrote much better than you do',
when I had to admit that there was no point of likeness between
them. Then she had gone further and broken the sequence—the
expected order. Perhaps she had done this unconsciously, merely
giving things their natural order, as a woman would, if she wrote
like a woman. But the effect was somehow baffling; one could not
see a wave heaping itself, a crisis coming round the next corner.
Therefore I could not plume myself either upon the depths of my
feelings and my profound knowledge of the human heart. For whenever
I was about to feel the usual things in the usual places, about
love, about death, the annoying creature twitched me away, as if
the important point were just a little further on. And thus she
made it impossible for me to roll out my sonorous phrases about
'elemental feelings', the 'common stuff of humanity', 'the depths
of the human heart', and ail those other phrases which support us
in our belief that, however clever we may be on top, we are very
serious, very profound and very humane underneath. She made me
feel, on the contrary, that instead of being serious and profound
and humane, one might be—and the thought was far less
seductive—merely lazy minded and conventional into the bargain.</p>
<p>But I read on, and noted certain other facts. She was no
'genius' that was evident. She had nothing like the love of Nature,
the fiery imagination, the wild poetry, the brilliant wit, the
brooding wisdom of her great predecessors, Lady Winchilsea,
Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Jane Austen and George Eliot; she
could not write with the melody and the dignity of Dorothy
Osborne—indeed she was no more than a clever girl whose books will
no doubt be pulped by the publishers in ten years' time. But,
nevertheless, she had certain advantages which women of far greater
gift lacked even half a century ago. Men were no longer to her 'the
opposing faction'; she need not waste her time railing against
them; she need not climb on to the roof and ruin her peace of mind
longing for travel, experience and a knowledge of the world and
character that were denied her. Fear and hatred were almost gone,
or traces of them showed only in a slight exaggeration of the joy
of freedom, a tendency to the caustic and satirical, rather than to
the romantic, in her treatment of the other sex. Then there could
be no doubt that as a novelist she enjoyed some natural advantages
of a high order. She had a sensibility that was very wide, eager
and free. It responded to an almost imperceptible touch on it. It
feasted like a plant newly stood in the air on every sight and
sound that came its way. It ranged, too, very subtly and curiously,
among almost unknown or unrecorded things; it lighted on small
things and showed that perhaps they were not small after all. It
brought buried things to light and made one wonder what need there
had been to bury them. Awkward though she was and without the
unconscious bearing of long descent which makes the least turn of
the pen of a Thackeray or a Lamb delightful to the ear, she had—I
began to think—mastered the first great lesson; she wrote as a
woman, but as a woman who has forgotten that she is a woman, so
that her pages were full of that curious sexual quality which comes
only when sex is unconscious of itself.</p>
<p>All this was to the good. But no abundance of sensation or
fineness of perception would avail unless she could build up out of
the fleeting and the personal the lasting edifice which remains
unthrown. I had said that I would wait until she faced herself with
'a situation'. And I meant by that until she proved by summoning,
beckoning and getting together that she was not a skimmer of
surfaces merely, but had looked beneath into the depths. Now is the
time, she would say to herself at a certain moment, when without
doing anything violent I can show the meaning of all this. And she
would begin—how unmistakable that quickening is!—beckoning and
summoning, and there would rise up in memory, half forgotten,
perhaps quite trivial things in other chapters dropped by the way.
And she would make their presence felt while someone sewed or
smoked a pipe as naturally as possible, and one would feel, as she
went on writing, as if one had gone to the top of the world and
seen it laid out, very majestically, beneath.</p>
<p>At any rate, she was making the attempt. And as I watched her
lengthening out for the test, I saw, but hoped that she did not
see, the bishops and the deans, the doctors and the professors, the
patriarchs and the pedagogues all at her shouting warning and
advice. You can't do this and you shan't do that! Fellows and
scholars only allowed on the grass! Ladies not admitted without a
letter of introduction! Aspiring and graceful female novelists this
way! So they kept at her like the crowd at a fence on the
racecourse, and it was her trial to take her fence without looking
to right or to left. If you stop to curse you are lost, I said to
her; equally, if you stop to laugh. Hesitate or fumble and you are
done for. Think only of the jump, I implored her, as if I had put
the whole of my money on her back; and she went over it like a
bird. But there was a fence beyond that and a fence beyond that.
Whether she had the staying power I was doubtful, for the clapping
and the crying were fraying to the nerves. But she did her best.
Considering that Mary Carmichael was no genius, but an unknown girl
writing her first novel in a bed-sitting-room, without enough of
those desirable things, time, money and idleness, she did not do so
badly, I thought.</p>
<p>Give her another hundred years, I concluded, reading the last
chapter—people's noses and bare shoulders showed naked against a
starry sky, for someone had twitched the curtain in the
drawing-room—give her a room of her own and five hundred a year,
let her speak her mind and leave out half that she now puts in, and
she will write a better book one of these days. She will be a poet,
I said, putting LIFE'S ADVENTURE, by Mary Carmichael, at the end of
the shelf, in another hundred years' time.</p>
