<p>Everything was perfectly swell.</p>
<p>There were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples,
no poverty, no wars.</p>
<p>All diseases were conquered. So was old age.</p>
<p>Death, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.</p>
<p>The population of the United States was stabilized at
forty-million souls.</p>
<p>One bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named
Edward K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was
the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.</p>
<p>Wehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose
average age was one hundred and twenty-nine.</p>
<p>X-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets.
The children would be his first.</p>
<p>Young Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He
was so rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually
invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a
disorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been
moved away from the walls. The floor was paved with spattered
dropcloths.</p>
<p>The room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a
memorial to a man who had volunteered to die.</p>
<p>A sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a
stepladder, painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when
people aged visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five
or so. Aging had touched him that much before the cure for aging
was found.</p>
<p>The mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and
women in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted
seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.</p>
<p>Men and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down
plants that were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to
trash-burners.</p>
<p>Never, never, never—not even in medieval Holland nor old
Japan—had a garden been more formal, been better tended. Every
plant had all the loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could
use.</p>
<p>A hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his
breath a popular song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't like my kisses, honey,</p>
<p>Here's what I will do:</p>
<p>I'll go see a girl in purple,</p>
<p>Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.</p>
<p>If you don't want my lovin',</p>
<p>Why should I take up all this space?</p>
<p>I'll get off this old planet,</p>
<p>Let some sweet baby have my place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. "Looks so
real," he said, "I can practically imagine I'm standing in the
middle of it."</p>
<p>"What makes you think you're not in it?" said the painter. He
gave a satiric smile. "It's called 'The Happy Garden of Life,' you
know."</p>
<p>"That's good of Dr. Hitz," said the orderly.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head
was a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief
Obstetrician. Hitz was a blindingly handsome man.</p>
<p>"Lot of faces still to fill in," said the orderly. He meant that
the faces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All
blanks were to be filled with portraits of important people on
either the hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal
Bureau of Termination.</p>
<p>"Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like
something," said the orderly.</p>
<p>The painter's face curdled with scorn. "You think I'm proud of
this daub?" he said. "You think this is my idea of what life really
looks like?"</p>
<p>"What's your idea of what life looks like?" said the
orderly.</p>
<p>The painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. "There's a good
picture of it," he said. "Frame that, and you'll have a picture a
damn sight more honest than this one."</p>
<p>"You're a gloomy old duck, aren't you?" said the orderly.</p>
<p>"Is that a crime?" said the painter.</p>
<p>The orderly shrugged. "If you don't like it here, Grandpa—" he
said, and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number
that people who didn't want to live any more were supposed to call.
The zero in the telephone number he pronounced "naught."</p>
<p>The number was: "2 B R 0 2 B."</p>
<p>It was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful
sobriquets included: "Automat," "Birdland," "Cannery," "Catbox,"
"De-louser," "Easy-go," "Good-by, Mother," "Happy Hooligan,"
"Kiss-me-quick," "Lucky Pierre," "Sheepdip," "Waring Blendor,"
"Weep-no-more" and "Why Worry?"</p>
<p>"To be or not to be" was the telephone number of the municipal
gas chambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. "When I decide it's
time to go," he said, "it won't be at the Sheepdip."</p>
<p>"A do-it-yourselfer, eh?" said the orderly. "Messy business,
Grandpa. Why don't you have a little consideration for the people
who have to clean up after you?"</p>
<p>The painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for
the tribulations of his survivors. "The world could do with a good
deal more mess, if you ask me," he said.</p>
<p>The orderly laughed and moved on.</p>
<p>Wehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising
his head. And then he fell silent again.</p>
<p>A coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike
heels. Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were
all purple, the purple the painter called "the color of grapes on
Judgment Day."</p>
<p>The medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the
Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle
perched on a turnstile.</p>
<p>The woman had a lot of facial hair—an unmistakable mustache, in
fact. A curious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no
matter how lovely and feminine they were when recruited, they all
sprouted mustaches within five years or so.</p>
<p>"Is this where I'm supposed to come?" she said to the
painter.</p>
<p>"A lot would depend on what your business was," he said. "You
aren't about to have a baby, are you?"</p>
<p>"They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture," she
said. "My name's Leora Duncan." She waited.</p>
<p>"And you dunk people," he said.</p>
<p>"What?" she said.</p>
<p>"Skip it," he said.</p>
<p>"That sure is a beautiful picture," she said. "Looks just like
heaven or something."</p>
<p>"Or something," said the painter. He took a list of names from
his smock pocket. "Duncan, Duncan, Duncan," he said, scanning the
list. "Yes—here you are. You're entitled to be immortalized. See
any faceless body here you'd like me to stick your head on? We've
got a few choice ones left."</p>
<p>She studied the mural bleakly. "Gee," she said, "they're all the
same to me. I don't know anything about art."</p>
<p>"A body's a body, eh?" he said, "All righty. As a master of fine
art, I recommend this body here." He indicated a faceless figure of
a woman who was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.</p>
<p>"Well," said Leora Duncan, "that's more the disposal people,
isn't it? I mean, I'm in service. I don't do any disposing."</p>
<p>The painter clapped his hands in mock delight. "You say you
don't know anything about art, and then you prove in the next
breath that you know more about it than I do! Of course the
sheave-carrier is wrong for a hostess! A snipper, a pruner—that's
more your line." He pointed to a figure in purple who was sawing a
dead branch from an apple tree. "How about her?" he said. "You like
her at all?"</p>
<p>"Gosh—" she said, and she blushed and became humble—"that—that
puts me right next to Dr. Hitz."</p>
<p>"That upsets you?" he said.</p>
<p>"Good gravy, no!" she said. "It's—it's just such an honor."</p>
<p>"Ah, You admire him, eh?" he said.</p>
<p>"Who doesn't admire him?" she said, worshiping the portrait of
Hitz. It was the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent
Zeus, two hundred and forty years old. "Who doesn't admire him?"
she said again. "He was responsible for setting up the very first
gas chamber in Chicago."</p>
<p>"Nothing would please me more," said the painter, "than to put
you next to him for all time. Sawing off a limb—that strikes you as
appropriate?"</p>
<p>"That is kind of like what I do," she said. She was demure about
what she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she
killed them.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the
waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and
he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of
living.</p>
<p>"Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!" he said, and he made a joke.
"What are you doing here?" he said. "This isn't where the people
leave. This is where they come in!"</p>
<p>"We're going to be in the same picture together," she said
shyly.</p>
<p>"Good!" said Dr. Hitz heartily. "And, say, isn't that some
picture?"</p>
<p>"I sure am honored to be in it with you," she said.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you," he said, "I'm honored to be in it with you.
Without women like you, this wonderful world we've got wouldn't be
possible."</p>
<p>He saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the
delivery rooms. "Guess what was just born," he said.</p>
<p>"I can't," she said.</p>
<p>"Triplets!" he said.</p>
<p>"Triplets!" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal
implications of triplets.</p>
<p>The law said that no newborn child could survive unless the
parents of the child could find someone who would volunteer to die.
Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three
volunteers.</p>
<p>"Do the parents have three volunteers?" said Leora Duncan.</p>
<p>"Last I heard," said Dr. Hitz, "they had one, and were trying to
scrape another two up."</p>
<p>"I don't think they made it," she said. "Nobody made three
appointments with us. Nothing but singles going through today,
unless somebody called in after I left. What's the name?"</p>
<p>"Wehling," said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and
frowzy. "Edward K. Wehling, Jr., is the name of the happy
father-to-be."</p>
<p>He raised his right hand, looked at a spot on the wall, gave a
hoarsely wretched chuckle. "Present," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Wehling," said Dr. Hitz, "I didn't see you."</p>
<p>"The invisible man," said Wehling.</p>
<p>"They just phoned me that your triplets have been born," said
Dr. Hitz. "They're all fine, and so is the mother. I'm on my way in
to see them now."</p>
<p>"Hooray," said Wehling emptily.</p>
<p>"You don't sound very happy," said Dr. Hitz.</p>
<p>"What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?" said Wehling. He
gestured with his hands to symbolize care-free simplicity. "All I
have to do is pick out which one of the triplets is going to live,
then deliver my maternal grandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and
come back here with a receipt."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Dr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him.
"You don't believe in population control, Mr. Wehling?" he
said.</p>
<p>"I think it's perfectly keen," said Wehling tautly.</p>
<p>"Would you like to go back to the good old days, when the
population of the Earth was twenty billion—about to become forty
billion, then eighty billion, then one hundred and sixty billion?
Do you know what a drupelet is, Mr. Wehling?" said Hitz.</p>
<p>"Nope," said Wehling sulkily.</p>
<p>"A drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the
little pulpy grains of a blackberry," said Dr. Hitz. "Without
population control, human beings would now be packed on this
surface of this old planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of
it!"</p>
<p>Wehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall.</p>
<p>"In the year 2000," said Dr. Hitz, "before scientists stepped in
and laid down the law, there wasn't even enough drinking water to
go around, and nothing to eat but sea-weed—and still people
insisted on their right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their
right, if possible, to live forever."</p>
<p>"I want those kids," said Wehling quietly. "I want all three of
them."</p>
<p>"Of course you do," said Dr. Hitz. "That's only human."</p>
<p>"I don't want my grandfather to die, either," said Wehling.</p>
<p>"Nobody's really happy about taking a close relative to the
Catbox," said Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically.</p>
<p>"I wish people wouldn't call it that," said Leora Duncan.</p>
<p>"What?" said Dr. Hitz.</p>
<p>"I wish people wouldn't call it 'the Catbox,' and things like
that," she said. "It gives people the wrong impression."</p>
<p>"You're absolutely right," said Dr. Hitz. "Forgive me." He
corrected himself, gave the municipal gas chambers their official
title, a title no one ever used in conversation. "I should have
said, 'Ethical Suicide Studios,'" he said.</p>
<p>"That sounds so much better," said Leora Duncan.</p>
<p>"This child of yours—whichever one you decide to keep, Mr.
Wehling," said Dr. Hitz. "He or she is going to live on a happy,
roomy, clean, rich planet, thanks to population control. In a
garden like that mural there." He shook his head. "Two centuries
ago, when I was a young man, it was a hell that nobody thought
could last another twenty years. Now centuries of peace and plenty
stretch before us as far as the imagination cares to travel."</p>
<p>He smiled luminously.</p>
<p>The smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a
revolver.</p>
<p>Wehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. "There's room for one—a great big
one," he said.</p>
<p>And then he shot Leora Duncan. "It's only death," he said to her
as she fell. "There! Room for two."</p>
<p>And then he shot himself, making room for all three of his
children.</p>
<p>Nobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots.</p>
<p>The painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down
reflectively on the sorry scene.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be
born and, once born, demanding to be fruitful&#160;… to multiply
and to live as long as possible—to do all that on a very small
planet that would have to last forever.</p>
<p>All the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even
grimmer, surely, than a Catbox, a Happy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He
thought of war. He thought of plague. He thought of starvation.</p>
<p>He knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush
fall to the drop-cloths below. And then he decided he had had about
enough of life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly
down from the ladder.</p>
<p>He took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself.</p>
<p>But he didn't have the nerve.</p>
<p>And then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room.
He went to it, dialed the well-remembered number: "2 B R 0 2
B."</p>
<p>"Federal Bureau of Termination," said the very warm voice of a
hostess.</p>
<p>"How soon could I get an appointment?" he asked, speaking very
carefully.</p>
<p>"We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir," she
said. "It might even be earlier, if we get a cancellation."</p>
<p>"All right," said the painter, "fit me in, if you please." And
he gave her his name, spelling it out.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," said the hostess. "Your city thanks you; your
country thanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks
of all is from future generations."</p>
