<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith no greater
events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty
and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was
to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very
seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was
depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it
herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence
had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened
her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and
as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could
not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own
sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in
short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for
any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally
settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany
Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a
night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as
plan could be.</p>
<p>The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly
miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her
going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to
answer her letter.</p>
<p>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly
friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make
him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to
deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first
to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her
every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their
opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude,
an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most
sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether
married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and
pleasing.</p>
<p>Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make
her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter
Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had
nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to
with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth
loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He
could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and
knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his
information.</p>
<p>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so
early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr.
Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their
arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome
them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to
see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of
little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's
appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and
whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth,
prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day
passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping,
and the evening at one of the theatres.</p>
<p>Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object
was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,
in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled
to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was
reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.
Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit
in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at
different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the
former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.</p>
<p>"But my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss
King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."</p>
<p>"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial
affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does
discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid
of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because
he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want
to find out that he is mercenary."</p>
<p>"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I
shall know what to think."</p>
<p>"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of
her."</p>
<p>"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her
grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."</p>
<p>"No—what should he? If it were not allowable for him to
gain&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;affections because I had no money, what
occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not
care about, and who was equally poor?"</p>
<p>"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions
towards her so soon after this event."</p>
<p>"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those
elegant decorums which other people may observe.
If&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;does not object to it, why
should&#160;<em>we</em>?"</p>
<p>"<em>Her</em>&#160;not objecting does not
justify&#160;<em>him</em>. It only shows her being deficient in
something herself—sense or feeling."</p>
<p>"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you
choose.&#160;<em>He</em>&#160;shall be mercenary,
and&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;shall be foolish."</p>
<p>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;choose. I
should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has
lived so long in Derbyshire."</p>
<p>"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who
live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in
Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank
Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not
one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to
recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after
all."</p>
<p>"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of
disappointment."</p>
<p>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she
had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her
uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in
the summer.</p>
<p>"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.
Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes."</p>
<p>No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my
dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what
felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to
disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and
mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when
we&#160;<em>do</em>&#160;return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of
anything. We&#160;<em>will</em>&#160;know where we have
gone—we<em>will</em>&#160;recollect what we have seen. Lakes,
mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation.
Let&#160;<em>our</em>&#160;first effusions be less insupportable
than those of the generality of travellers."</p>
