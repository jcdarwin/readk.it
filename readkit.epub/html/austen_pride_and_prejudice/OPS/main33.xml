<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth was
sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs.
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she
was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely
to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away
her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent
questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise,
Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.</p>
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised
for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all
the ladies were to be within.</p>
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were
made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was
absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this
emergence recollecting&#160;<em>when</em>&#160;she had seen him
last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would
say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:</p>
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,
Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr.
Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect
right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I
hope, when you left London?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."</p>
<p>She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a
short pause added:</p>
<p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of
ever returning to Netherfield again?"</p>
<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may
spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many
friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are
continually increasing."</p>
<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better
for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely,
for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,
perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the
convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect
him to keep it or quit it on the same principle."</p>
<p>"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it
up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of
his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to
leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.</p>
<p>He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very
comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to
it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."</p>
<p>"I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."</p>
<p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a
wife."</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met
with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted
him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent
understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying
Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly
happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very
good match for her."</p>
<p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy
a distance of her own family and friends."</p>
<p>"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty
miles."</p>
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a
day's journey. Yes, I call it a&#160;<em>very</em>&#160;easy
distance."</p>
<p>"I should never have considered the distance as one of
the&#160;<em>advantages</em>&#160;of the match," cried Elizabeth.
"I should never have said Mrs. Collins was
settled&#160;<em>near</em>&#160;her family."</p>
<p>"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything
beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear
far."</p>
<p>As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied
she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:</p>
<p>"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near
her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on
many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the
expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But
that is not the case&#160;<em>here</em>. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have
a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent
journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call
herself&#160;<em>near</em>&#160;her family under less
than&#160;<em>half</em>&#160;the present distance."</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,
"<em>You</em>&#160;cannot have a right to such very strong local
attachment.&#160;<em>You</em>&#160;cannot have been always at
Longbourn."</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some
change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from
the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:</p>
<p>"Are you pleased with Kent?"</p>
<p>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either
side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of
Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The
tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had
occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few
minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.</p>
<p>"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he
was gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would
never have called us in this familiar way."</p>
<p>But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very
likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after
various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to
proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was
the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were
over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a
billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in
the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to
it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a
temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately,
sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It
was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had
pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction
in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of
her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them,
she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel
Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed
mind.</p>
<p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more
difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he
frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips;
and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather
than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.
He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to
make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his
stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own
knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to
have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of
that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to
find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and
whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of
that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but
she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and
sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.</p>
<p>She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of
his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;
and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from
the danger of raising expectations which might only end in
disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that
all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to
be in her power.</p>
<p>In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her
marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most
pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life
was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.
Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin
could have none at all.</p>
