<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>appy for all her
maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her
two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be
guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so
many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a
sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life;
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have
relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was
occasionally nervous and invariably silly.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection
for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He
delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least
expected.</p>
<p>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not
desirable even to&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;easy temper,
or&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;affectionate heart. The darling wish of
his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a
neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in
addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty
miles of each other.</p>
<p>Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her
time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she
had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so
ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of
Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management,
less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further
disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept,
and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay
with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would
never consent to her going.</p>
<p>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was
necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix
more with the world, but she could still moralize over every
morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons
between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her
father that she submitted to the change without much
reluctance.</p>
<p>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no
revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with
philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted
with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been
unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without
hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The
congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her
marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by
himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:</p>
<p>"MY DEAR LIZZY,</p>
<p>"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my
dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have
you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four
hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if
you had rather not.</p>
<p>"Yours, etc."</p>
<p>As it happened that Elizabeth had&#160;<em>much</em>&#160;rather
not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty
and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her
power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in
her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always
been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the
direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and
heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support;
and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself
were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His
affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little
longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all
the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.</p>
<p>Though Darcy could never receive&#160;<em>him</em>&#160;at
Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in
his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her
husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the
Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even
Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to
talk of giving them a hint to be gone.</p>
<p>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but
as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at
Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of
Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off
every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the
sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to
love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the
highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she
often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her
lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had
always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her
affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind
received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By
Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may
take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always
allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.</p>
<p>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her
nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her
character in her reply to the letter which announced its
arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of
Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at
length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook
the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further
resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either
to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife
conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at
Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received,
not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of
her uncle and aunt from the city.</p>
<p>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both
ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by
bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting
them.</p>
