<p>Next day the light of the October morning was falling in dusty
shafts through the uncurtained windows, and the hum of traffic rose
from the street. London then was winding itself up again; the
factory was astir; the machines were beginning. It was tempting,
after all this reading, to look out of the window and see what
London was doing on the morning of the 26th of October 1928. And
what was London doing? Nobody, it seemed, was reading ANTONY AND
CLEOPATRA. London was wholly indifferent, it appeared, to
Shakespeare's plays. Nobody cared a straw—and I do not blame
them—for the future of fiction, the death of poetry or the
development by the average woman of a prose style completely
expressive of her mind. If opinions upon any of these matters had
been chalked on the pavement, nobody would have stooped to read
them. The nonchalance of the hurrying feet would have rubbed them
out in half an hour. Here came an errand-boy; here a woman with a
dog on a lead. The fascination of the London street is that no two
people are ever alike; each seems bound on some private affair of
his own. There were the business-like, with their little bags;
there were the drifters rattling sticks upon area railings; there
were affable characters to whom the streets serve for clubroom,
hailing men in carts and giving information without being asked for
it. Also there were funerals to which men, thus suddenly reminded
of the passing of their own bodies, lifted their hats. And then a
very distinguished gentleman came slowly down a doorstep and paused
to avoid collision with a bustling lady who had, by some means or
other, acquired a splendid fur coat and a bunch of Parma violets.
They all seemed separate, self-absorbed, on business of their
own.</p>
<p>At this moment, as so often happens in London, there was a
complete lull and suspension of traffic. Nothing came down the
street; nobody passed. A single leaf detached itself from the plane
tree at the end of the street, and in that pause and suspension
fell. Somehow it was like a signal falling, a signal pointing to a
force in things which one had overlooked. It seemed to point to a
river, which flowed past, invisibly, round the corner, down the
street, and took people and eddied them along, as the stream at
Oxbridge had taken the undergraduate in his boat and the dead
leaves. Now it was bringing from one side of the street to the
other diagonally a girl in patent leather boots, and then a young
man in a maroon overcoat; it was also bringing a taxi-cab; and it
brought all three together at a point directly beneath my window;
where the taxi stopped; and the girl and the young man stopped; and
they got into the taxi; and then the cab glided off as if it were
swept on by the current elsewhere.</p>
<p>The sight was ordinary enough; what was strange was the
rhythmical order with which my imagination had invested it; and the
fact that the ordinary sight of two people getting into a cab had
the power to communicate something of their own seeming
satisfaction. The sight of two people coming down the street and
meeting at the corner seems to ease the mind of some strain, I
thought, watching the taxi turn and make off. Perhaps to think, as
I had been thinking these two days, of one sex as distinct from the
other is an effort. It interferes with the unity of the mind. Now
that effort had ceased and that unity had been restored by seeing
two people come together and get into a taxicab. The mind is
certainly a very mysterious organ, I reflected, drawing my head in
from the window, about which nothing whatever is known, though we
depend upon it so completely. Why do I feel that there are
severances and oppositions in the mind, as there are strains from
obvious causes on the body? What does one mean by 'the unity of the
mind'? I pondered, for clearly the mind has so great a power of
concentrating at any point at any moment that it seems to have no
single state of being. It can separate itself from the people in
the street, for example, and think of itself as apart from them, at
an upper window looking down on them. Or it can think with other
people spontaneously, as, for instance, in a crowd waiting to hear
some piece of news read out. it can think back through its fathers
or through its mothers, as I have said that a woman writing thinks
back through her mothers. Again if one is a woman one is often
surprised by a sudden splitting off of consciousness, say in
walking down Whitehall, when from being the natural inheritor of
that civilization, she becomes, on the contrary, outside of it,
alien and critical. Clearly the mind is always altering its focus,
and bringing the world into different perspectives. But some of
these states of mind seem, even if adopted spontaneously, to be
less comfortable than others. In order to keep oneself continuing
in them one is unconsciously holding something back, and gradually
the repression becomes an effort. But there may be some state of
mind in which one could continue without effort because nothing is
required to be held back. And this perhaps, I thought, coming in
from the window, is one of them. For certainly when I saw the
couple get into the taxicab the mind felt as if, after being
divided, it had come together again in a natural fusion. The
obvious reason would be that it is natural for the sexes to
co-operate. One has a profound, if irrational, instinct in favour
of the theory that the union of man and woman makes for the
greatest satisfaction, the most complete happiness. But the sight
of the two people getting into the taxi and the satisfaction it
gave me made me also ask whether there are two sexes in the mind
corresponding to the two sexes in the body, and whether they also
require to be united in order to get complete satisfaction and
happiness? And I went on amateurishly to sketch a plan of the soul
so that in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female; and
in the man's brain the man predominates over the woman, and in the
woman's brain the woman predominates over the man. The normal and
comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony
together, spiritually co-operating. If one is a man, still the
woman part of his brain must have effect; and a woman also must
have intercourse with the man in her. Coleridge perhaps meant this
when he said that a great mind is androgynous. It is when this
fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilized and uses all
its faculties. Perhaps a mind that is purely masculine cannot
create, any more than a mind that is purely feminine, I thought.
But it would he well to test what one meant by man-womanly, and
conversely by woman-manly, by pausing and looking at a book or
two.</p>
<p>Coleridge certainly did not mean, when he said that a great mind
is androgynous, that it is a mind that has any special sympathy
with women; a mind that takes up their cause or devotes itself to
their interpretation. Perhaps the androgynous mind is less apt to
make these distinctions than the single-sexed mind. He meant,
perhaps, that the androgynous mind is resonant and porous; that it
transmits emotion without impediment; that it is naturally
creative, incandescent and undivided. In fact one goes back to
Shakespeare's mind as the type of the androgynous, of the
man-womanly mind, though it would be impossible to say what
Shakespeare thought of women. And if it be true that it is one of
the tokens of the fully developed mind that it does not think
specially or separately of sex, how much harder it is to attain
that condition now than ever before. Here I came to the books by
living writers, and there paused and wondered if this fact were not
at the root of something that had long puzzled me. No age can ever
have been as stridently sex-conscious as our own; those innumerable
books by men about women in the British Museum are a proof of it.
The Suffrage campaign was no doubt to blame. It must have roused in
men an extraordinary desire for self-assertion; it must have made
them lay an emphasis upon their own sex and its characteristics
which they would not have troubled to think about had they not been
challenged. And when one is challenged, even by a few women in
black bonnets, one retaliates, if one has never been challenged
before, rather excessively. That perhaps accounts for some of the
characteristics that I remember to have found here, I thought,
taking down a new novel by Mr A, who is in the prime of life and
very well thought of, apparently, by the reviewers. I opened it.
Indeed, it was delightful to read a man's writing again. It was so
direct, so straightforward after the writing of women. It indicated
such freedom of mind, such liberty of person, such confidence in
himself. One had a sense of physical well-being in the presence of
this well-nourished, well-educated, free mind, which had never been
thwarted or opposed, but had had full liberty from birth to stretch
itself in whatever way it liked. All this was admirable. But after
reading a chapter or two a shadow seemed to lie across the page. it
was a straight dark bar, a shadow shaped something like the letter
'I'. One began dodging this way and that to catch a glimpse of the
landscape behind it. Whether that was indeed a tree or a woman
walking I was not quite sure. Back one was always hailed to the
letter 'I'. One began to be tired of 'I'. Not but what this 'I' was
a most respectable 'I'; honest and logical; as hard as a nut, and
polished for centuries by good teaching and good feeding. I respect
and admire that 'I' from the bottom of my heart. But—here I turned
a page or two, looking for something or other—the worst of it is
that in the shadow of the letter 'I' all is shapeless as mist. Is
that a tree? No, it is a woman. But… she has not a bone in her
body, I thought, watching Phoebe, for that was her name, coming
across the beach. Then Alan got up and the shadow of Alan at once
obliterated Phoebe. For Alan had views and Phoebe was quenched in
the flood of his views. And then Alan, I thought, has passions; and
here I turned page after page very fast, feeling that the crisis
was approaching, and so it was. It took place on the beach under
the sun. It was done very openly. It was done very vigorously.
Nothing could have been more indecent. But… I had said 'but' too
often. One cannot go on saying 'but'. One must finish the sentence
somehow, I rebuked myself. Shall I finish it, 'But—I am bored!' But
why was I bored? Partly because of the dominance of the letter 'I'
and the aridity, which, like the giant beech tree, it casts within
its shade. Nothing will grow there. And partly for some more
obscure reason. There seemed to be some obstacle, some impediment
in Mr A's mind which blocked the fountain of creative energy and
shored it within narrow limits. And remembering the lunch party at
Oxbridge, and the cigarette ash and the Manx cat and Tennyson and
Christina Rossetti all in a bunch, it seemed possible that the
impediment lay there. As he no longer hums under his breath, 'There
has fallen a splendid tear from the passion-flower at the gate',
when Phoebe crosses the beach, and she no longer replies, 'My heart
is like a singing bird whose nest is in a water'd shoot', when Alan
approaches what can he do? Being honest as the day and logical as
the sun, there is only one thing he can do. And that he does, to do
him justice, over and over (I said turning the pages) and over
again. And that, I added, aware of the awful nature of the
confession, seems somehow dull. Shakespeare's indecency uproots a
thousand other things in one's mind, and is far from being dull.
But Shakespeare does it for pleasure; Mr A, as the nurses say, does
it on purpose. He does it in protest. He is protesting against the
equality of the other sex by asserting his own superiority. He is
therefore impeded and inhibited and self-conscious as Shakespeare
might have been if he too had known Miss Clough and Miss Davies.
Doubtless Elizabethan literature would have been very different
from what it is if the women's movement had begun in the sixteenth
century and not in the nineteenth.</p>
<p>What, then, it amounts to, if this theory of the two sides of
the mind holds good, is that virility has now become
self-conscious—men, that is to say, are now writing only with the
male side of their brains. It is a mistake for a woman to read
them, for she will inevitably look for something that she will not
find. It is the power of suggestion that one most misses, I
thought, taking Mr B the critic in my hand and reading, very
carefully and very dutifully, his remarks upon the art of poetry.
Very able they were, acute and full of learning; but the trouble
was that his feelings no longer communicated; his mind seemed
separated into different chambers; not a sound carried from one to
the other. Thus, when one takes a sentence of Mr B into the mind it
falls plump to the ground—dead; but when one takes a sentence of
Coleridge into the mind, it explodes and gives birth to all kinds
of other ideas, and that is the only sort of writing of which one
can say that it has the secret of perpetual life.</p>
<p>But whatever the reason may be, it is a fact that one must
deplore. For it means—here I had come to rows of books by Mr
Galsworthy and Mr Kipling—that some of the finest works of our
greatest living writers fall upon deaf ears. Do what she will a
woman cannot find in them that fountain of perpetual life which the
critics assure her is there. It is not only that they celebrate
male virtues, enforce male values and describe the world of men; it
is that the emotion with which these books are permeated is to a
woman incomprehensible. It is coming, it is gathering, it is about
to burst on one's head, one begins saying long before the end. That
picture will fall on old Jolyon's head; he will die of the shock;
the old clerk will speak over him two or three obituary words; and
all the swans on the Thames will simultaneously burst out singing.
But one will rush away before that happens and hide in the
gooseberry bushes, for the emotion which is so deep, so subtle, so
symbolical to a man moves a woman to wonder. So with Mr Kipling's
officers who turn their Backs; and his Sowers who sow the Seed; and
his Men who are alone with their Work; and the Flag—one blushes at
all these capital letters as if one had been caught eavesdropping
at some purely masculine orgy. The fact is that neither Mr
Galsworthy nor Mr Kipling has a spark of the woman in him. Thus all
their qualities seem to a woman, if one may generalize, crude and
immature. They lack suggestive power. And when a book lacks
suggestive power, however hard it hits the surface of the mind it
cannot penetrate within.</p>
<p>And in that restless mood in which one takes books out and puts
them back again without looking at them I began to envisage an age
to come of pure, of self-assertive virility, such as the letters of
professors (take Sir Walter Raleigh's letters, for instance) seem
to forebode, and the rulers of Italy have already brought into
being. For one can hardly fail to be impressed in Rome by the sense
of unmitigated masculinity; and whatever the value of unmitigated
masculinity upon the state, one may question the effect of it upon
the art of poetry. At any rate, according to the newspapers, there
is a certain anxiety about fiction in Italy. There has been a
meeting of academicians whose object it is 'to develop the Italian
novel'. 'Men famous by birth, or in finance, industry or the
Fascist corporations' came together the other day and discussed the
matter, and a telegram was sent to the Duce expressing the hope
'that the Fascist era would soon give birth to a poet worthy of
it'. We may all join in that pious hope, but it is doubtful whether
poetry can come of an incubator. Poetry ought to have a mother as
well as a father. The Fascist poem, one may fear, will be a horrid
little abortion such as one sees in a glass jar in the museum of
some county town. Such monsters never live long, it is said; one
has never seen a prodigy of that sort cropping grass in a field.
Two heads on one body do not make for length of life.</p>
<p>However, the blame for all this, if one is anxious to lay blame,
rests no more upon one sex than upon the other. All seducers and
reformers are responsible: Lady Bessborough when she lied to Lord
Granville; Miss Davies when she told the truth to Mr Greg. All who
have brought about a state of sex-consciousness are to blame, and
it is they who drive me, when I want to stretch my faculties on a
book, to seek it in that happy age, before Miss Davies and Miss
Clough were born, when the writer used both sides of his mind
equally. One must turn back to Shakespeare then, for Shakespeare
was androgynous; and so were Keats and Sterne and Cowper and Lamb
and Coleridge. Shelley perhaps was sexless. Milton and Ben Jonson
had a dash too much of the male in them. So had Wordsworth and
Tolstoi. In our time Proust was wholly androgynous, if not perhaps
a little too much of a woman. But that failing is too rare for one
to complain of it, since without some mixture of the kind the
intellect seems to predominate and the other faculties of the mind
harden and become barren. However, I consoled myself with the
reflection that this is perhaps a passing phase; much of what I
have said in obedience to my promise to give you the course of my
thoughts will seem out of date; much of what flames in my eyes will
seem dubious to you who have not yet come of age.</p>
<p>Even so, the very first sentence that I would write here, I
said, crossing over to the writing-table and taking up the page
headed Women and Fiction, is that it is fatal for anyone who writes
to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and
simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a
woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with
justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman. And
fatal is no figure of speech; for anything written with that
conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilized.
Brilliant and effective, powerful and masterly, as it may appear
for a day or two, it must wither at nightfall; it cannot grow in
the minds of others. Some collaboration has to take place in the
mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can
be accomplished. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated.
The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense
that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect
fullness. There must be freedom and there must be peace. Not a
wheel must grate, not a light glimmer. The curtains must be close
drawn. The writer, I thought, once his experience is over, must lie
back and let his mind celebrate its nuptials in darkness. He must
not look or question what is being done. Rather, he must pluck the
petals from a rose or watch the swans float calmly down the river.
And I saw again the current which took the boat and the
under-graduate and the dead leaves; and the taxi took the man and
the woman, I thought, seeing them come together across the street,
and the current swept them away, I thought, hearing far off the
roar of London's traffic, into that tremendous stream.</p>
<p>Here, then, Mary Beton ceases to speak. She has told you how she
reached the conclusion—the prosaic conclusion—that it is necessary
to have five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door if
you are to write fiction or poetry. She has tried to lay bare the
thoughts and impressions that led her to think this. She has asked
you to follow her flying into the arms of a Beadle, lunching here,
dining there, drawing pictures in the British Museum, taking books
from the shelf, looking out of the window. While she has been doing
all these things, you no doubt have been observing her failings and
foibles and deciding what effect they have had on her opinions. You
have been contradicting her and making whatever additions and
deductions seem good to you. That is all as it should be, for in a
question like this truth is only to be had by laying together many
varieties of error. And I will end now in my own person by
anticipating two criticisms, so obvious that you can hardly fail to
make them.</p>
<p>No opinion has been expressed, you may say, upon the comparative
merits of the sexes even as writers. That was done purposely,
because, even if the time had come for such a valuation—and it is
far more important at the moment to know how much money women had
and how many rooms than to theorize about their capacities—even if
the time had come I do not believe that gifts, whether of mind or
character, can be weighed like sugar and butter, not even in
Cambridge, where they are so adept at putting people into classes
and fixing caps on their heads and letters after their names. I do
not believe that even the Table of Precedency which you will find
in Whitaker's ALMANAC represents a final order of values, or that
there is any sound reason to suppose that a Commander of the Bath
will ultimately walk in to dinner behind a Master in Lunacy. All
this pitting of sex against sex, of quality against quality; all
this claiming of superiority and imputing of inferiority, belong to
the private-school stage of human existence where there are
'sides', and it is necessary for one side to beat another side, and
of the utmost importance to walk up to a platform and receive from
the hands of the Headmaster himself a highly ornamental pot. As
people mature they cease to believe in sides or in Headmasters or
in highly ornamental pots. At any rate, where books are concerned,
it is notoriously difficult to fix labels of merit in such a way
that they do not come off. Are not reviews of current literature a
perpetual illustration of the difficulty of judgement? 'This great
book', 'this worthless book', the same book is called by both
names. Praise and blame alike mean nothing. No, delightful as the
pastime of measuring may be, it is the most futile of all
occupations, and to submit to the decrees of the measurers the most
servile of attitudes. So long as you write what you wish to write,
that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only
for hours, nobody can say. But to sacrifice a hair of the head of
your vision, a shade of its colour, in deference to some Headmaster
with a silver pot in his hand or to some professor with a
measuring-rod up his sleeve, is the most abject treachery, and the
sacrifice of wealth and chastity which used to be said to be the
greatest of human disasters, a mere flea-bite in comparison.</p>
<p>Next I think that you may object that in all this I have made
too much of the importance of material things. Even allowing a
generous margin for symbolism, that five hundred a year stands for
the power to contemplate, that a lock on the door means the power
to think for oneself, still you may say that the mind should rise
above such things; and that great poets have often been poor men.
Let me then quote to you the words of your own Professor of
Literature, who knows better than I do what goes to the making of a
poet. Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch writes:'<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_10" id="footnote_10_call">[10]</a></p>
<p>'What are the great poetical names of the last hundred years or
so? Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, Landor, Keats, Tennyson,
Browning, Arnold, Morris, Rossetti, Swinburne—we may stop there. Of
these, all but Keats, Browning, Rossetti were University men, and
of these three, Keats, who died young, cut off in his prime, was
the only one not fairly well to do. It may seem a brutal thing to
say, and it is a sad thing to say: but, as a matter of hard fact,
the theory that poetical genius bloweth where it listeth, and
equally in poor and rich, holds little truth. As a matter of hard
fact, nine out of those twelve were University men: which means
that somehow or other they procured the means to get the best
education England can give. As a matter of hard fact, of the
remaining three you know that Browning was well to do, and I
challenge you that, if he had not been well to do, he would no more
have attained to write SAUL or THE RING AND THE BOOK than Ruskin
would have attained to writing MODERN PAINTERS if his father had
not dealt prosperously in business. Rossetti had a small private
income; and, moreover, he painted. There remains but Keats; whom
Atropos slew young, as she slew John Clare in a mad-house, and
James Thomson by the laudanum he took to drug disappointment. These
are dreadful facts, but let us face them. It is—however
dishonouring to us as a nation—certain that, by some fault in our
commonwealth, the poor poet has not in these days, nor has had for
two hundred years, a dog's chance. Believe me—and I have spent a
great part of ten years in watching some three hundred and twenty
elementary schools, we may prate of democracy, but actually, a poor
child in England has little more hope than had the son of an
Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of
which great writings are born.'</p>
<p>Nobody could put the point more plainly. 'The poor poet has not
in these days, nor has had for two hundred years, a dog's chance… a
poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an
Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of
which great writings are born.' That is it. Intellectual freedom
depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual
freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years
merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less
intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women, then,
have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. That is why I have
laid so much stress on money and a room of one's own. However,
thanks to the toils of those obscure women in the past, of whom I
wish we knew more, thanks, curiously enough to two wars, the
Crimean which let Florence Nightingale out of her drawing-room, and
the European War which opened the doors to the average woman some
sixty years later, these evils are in the way to be bettered.
Otherwise you would not be here tonight, and your chance of earning
five hundred pounds a year, precarious as I am afraid that it still
is, would be minute in the extreme.</p>
<p>Still, you may object, why do you attach so much importance to
this writing of books by women when, according to you, it requires
so much effort, leads perhaps to the murder of one's aunts, will
make one almost certainly late for luncheon, and may bring one into
very grave disputes with certain very good fellows? My motives, let
me admit, are partly selfish. Like most uneducated Englishwomen, I
like reading—I like reading books in the bulk. Lately my diet has
become a trifle monotonous; history is too much about wars;
biography too much about great men; poetry has shown, I think, a
tendency to sterility, and fiction but I have sufficiently exposed
my disabilities as a critic of modern fiction and will say no more
about it. Therefore I would ask you to write all kinds of books,
hesitating at no subject however trivial or however vast. By hook
or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money
enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past
of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and
let the line of thought dip deep into the stream. For I am by no
means confining you to fiction. If you would please me—and there
are thousands like me—you would write books of travel and
adventure, and research and scholarship, and history and biography,
and criticism and philosophy and science. By so doing you will
certainly profit the art of fiction. For books have a way of
influencing each other. Fiction will be much the better for
standing cheek by jowl with poetry and philosophy. Moreover, if you
consider any great figure of the past, like Sappho, like the Lady
Murasaki, like Emily Brontë, you will find that she is an inheritor
as well as an originator, and has come into existence because women
have come to have the habit of writing naturally; so that even as a
prelude to poetry such activity on your part would be
invaluable.</p>
<p>But when I look back through these notes and criticize my own
train of thought as I made them, I find that my motives were not
altogether selfish. There runs through these comments and
discursions the conviction—or is it the instinct?—that good books
are desirable and that good writers, even if they show every
variety of human depravity, are still good human beings. Thus when
I ask you to write more books I am urging you to do what will be
for your good and for the good of the world at large. How to
justify this instinct or belief I do not know, for philosophic
words, if one has not been educated at a university, are apt to
play one false. What is meant by 'reality'? It would seem to be
something very erratic, very undependable—now to be found in a
dusty road, now in a scrap of newspaper in the street, now a
daffodil in the sun. It lights up a group in a room and stamps some
casual saying. It overwhelms one walking home beneath the stars and
makes the silent world more real than the world of speech—and then
there it is again in an omnibus in the uproar of Piccadilly.
Sometimes, too, it seems to dwell in shapes too far away for us to
discern what their nature is. But whatever it touches, it fixes and
makes permanent. That is what remains over when the skin of the day
has been cast into the hedge; that is what is left of past time and
of our loves and hates. Now the writer, as I think, has the chance
to live more than other people in the presence of this reality. It
is his business to find it and collect it and communicate it to the
rest of us. So at least I infer from reading LEAR or EMMA or LA
RECHERCHE DU TEMPS PERDU. For the reading of these books seems to
perform a curious couching operation on the senses; one sees more
intensely afterwards; the world seems bared of its covering and
given an intenser life. Those are the enviable people who live at
enmity with unreality; and those are the pitiable who are knocked
on the head by the thing done without knowing or caring. So that
when I ask you to earn money and have a room of your own, I am
asking you to live in the presence of reality, an invigorating
life, it would appear, whether one can impart it or not.</p>
<p>Here I would stop, but the pressure of convention decrees that
every speech must end with a peroration. And a peroration addressed
to women should have something, you will agree, particularly
exalting and ennobling about it. I should implore you to remember
your responsibilities, to be higher, more spiritual; I should
remind, you how much depends upon you, and what an influence you
can exert upon the future. But those exhortations can safely, I
think, be left to the other sex, who will put them, and indeed have
put them, with far greater eloquence than I can compass. When I
rummage in my own mind I find no noble sentiments about being
companions and equals and influencing the world to higher ends. I
find myself saying briefly and prosaically that it is much more
important to be oneself than anything else. Do not dream of
influencing other people, I would say, if I knew how to make it
sound exalted. Think of things in themselves.</p>
<p>And again I am reminded by dipping into newspapers and novels
and biographies that when a woman speaks to women she should have
something very unpleasant up her sleeve. Women are hard on women.
Women dislike women. Women—but are you not sick to death of the
word? I can assure you that I am. Let us agree, then, that a paper
read by a woman to women should end with something particularly
disagreeable.</p>
<p>But how does it go? What can I think of? The truth is, I often
like women. I like their unconventionality. I like their
completeness. I like their anonymity. I like—but I must not run on
in this way. That cupboard there,—you say it holds clean
table-napkins only; but what if Sir Archibald Bodkin were concealed
among them? Let me then adopt a sterner tone. Have I, in the
preceding words, conveyed to you sufficiently the warnings and
reprobation of mankind? I have told you the very low opinion in
which you were held by Mr Oscar Browning. I have indicated what
Napoleon once thought of you and what Mussolini thinks now. Then,
in case any of you aspire to fiction, I have copied out for your
benefit the advice of the critic about courageously acknowledging
the limitations of your sex. I have referred to Professor X and
given prominence to his statement that women are intellectually,
morally and physically inferior to men. I have handed on all that
has come my way without going in search of it, and here is a final
warning—from Mr John Langdon Davies<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_11" id="footnote_11_call">[11]</a>. Mr John
Langdon Davies warns women 'that when children cease to be
altogether desirable, women cease to be altogether necessary'. I
hope you will make a note of it.</p>
<p>How can I further encourage you to go about the business of
life? Young women, I would say, and please attend, for the
peroration is beginning, you are, in my opinion, disgracefully
ignorant. You have never made a discovery of any sort of
importance. You have never shaken an empire or led an army into
battle. The plays of Shakespeare are not by you, and you have never
introduced a barbarous race to the blessings of civilization. What
is your excuse? It is all very well for you to say, pointing to the
streets and squares and forests of the globe swarming with black
and white and coffee-coloured inhabitants, all busily engaged in
traffic and enterprise and love-making, we have had other work on
our hands. Without our doing, those seas would be unsailed and
those fertile lands a desert. We have borne and bred and washed and
taught, perhaps to the age of six or seven years, the one thousand
six hundred and twenty-three million human beings who are,
according to statistics, at present in existence, and that,
allowing that some had help, takes time.</p>
<p>There is truth in what you say—I will not deny it. But at the
same time may I remind you that there have been at least two
colleges for women in existence in England since the year 1866;
that after the year 1880 a married woman was allowed by law to
possess her own property; and that in 1919—which is a whole nine
years ago she was given a vote? May I also remind you that most of
the professions have been open to you for close on ten years now?
When you reflect upon these immense privileges and the length of
time during which they have been enjoyed, and the fact that there
must be at this moment some two thousand women capable of earning
over five hundred a year in one way or another, you will agree that
the excuse of lack of opportunity, training, encouragement, leisure
and money no longer holds good. Moreover, the economists are
telling us that Mrs Seton has had too many children. You must, of
course, go on bearing children, but, so they say, in twos and
threes, not in tens and twelves.</p>
<p>Thus, with some time on your hands and with some book learning
in your brains—you have had enough of the other kind, and are sent
to college partly, I suspect, to be uneducated—surely you should
embark upon another stage of your very long, very laborious and
highly obscure career. A thousand pens are ready to suggest what
you should do and what effect you will have. My own suggestion is a
little fantastic, I admit; I prefer, therefore, to put it in the
form of fiction.</p>
<p>I told you in the course of this paper that Shakespeare had a
sister; but do not look for her in Sir Sidney Lee's life of the
poet. She died young—alas, she never wrote a word. She lies buried
where the omnibuses now stop, opposite the Elephant and Castle. Now
my belief is that this poet who never wrote a word and was buried
at the cross-roads still lives. She lives in you and in me, and in
many other women who are not here to-night, for they are washing up
the dishes and putting the children to bed. But she lives; for
great poets do not die; they are continuing presences; they need
only the opportunity to walk among us in the flesh. This
opportunity, as I think, it is now coming within your power to give
her. For my belief is that if we live another century or so—I am
talking of the common life which is the real life and not of the
little separate lives which we live as individuals—and have five
hundred a year each of us and rooms of our own; if we have the
habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think; if
we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human
beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation
to reality; and the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be
in themselves; if we look past Milton's bogey, for no human being
should shut out the view; if we face the fact, for it is a fact,
that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our
relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of
men and women, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who
was Shakespeare's sister will put on the body which she has so
often laid down. Drawing her life from the lives of the unknown who
were her forerunners, as her brother did before her, she will be
born. As for her coming without that preparation, without that
effort on our part, without that determination that when she is
born again she shall find it possible to live and write her poetry,
that we cannot expect, for that would he impossible. But I maintain
that she would come if we worked for her, and that so to work, even
in poverty and obscurity, is worth while.</p>
