<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he discomposure
of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into,
could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn
to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared,
had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for
the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the
report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss
to imagine; till she recollected that&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;being
the intimate friend of Bingley, and&#160;<em>her</em>&#160;being
the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of
one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea.
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine),
had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she
had looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>
<p>In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could
not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of
her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her
resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that
she must meditate an application to her nephew; and
how&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;might take a similar representation of
the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not
pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to
suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship
than&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;could do; and it was certain that, in
enumerating the miseries of a marriage with&#160;<em>one</em>,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt
would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity,
he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had
appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid
reasoning.</p>
<p>If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which
had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a
relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be
as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he
would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way
through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to
Netherfield must give way.</p>
<p>"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should
come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how
to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every
wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me,
when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon
cease to regret him at all."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their
visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it,
with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's
curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the
subject.</p>
<p>The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by
her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his
hand.</p>
<p>"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my
room."</p>
<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had
to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some
manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her
that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with
dismay all the consequent explanations.</p>
<p>She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat
down. He then said,</p>
<p>"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know
its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on
the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important
conquest."</p>
<p>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the
instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,
instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be
pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his
letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father
continued:</p>
<p>"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such
matters as these; but I think I may defy
even&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;sagacity, to discover the name of your
admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."</p>
<p>"From Mr. Collins! and what can&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;have to
say?"</p>
<p>"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter,
of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured,
gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by
reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as
follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of
Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short
hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by
the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will
not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has
resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably
looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this
land.'</p>
<p>"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" 'This
young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the
heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred,
and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let
me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may
incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals,
which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage
of.'</p>
<p>"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it
comes out:</p>
<p>"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to
imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on
the match with a friendly eye.'</p>
<p>"<em>Mr. Darcy</em>, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think
I&#160;<em>have</em>&#160;surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases,
have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance,
whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they
related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a
blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is
admirable!"</p>
<p>Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could
only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been
directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.</p>
<p>"Are you not diverted?"</p>
<p>"Oh! yes. Pray read on."</p>
<p>"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her
ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension,
expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent,
that on the score of some family objections on the part of my
cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so
disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest
intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer
may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a
marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins
moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that
their living together before the marriage took place should be so
generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my
station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you
received the young couple into your house as soon as they were
married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector
of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought
certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them
in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your
hearing.' That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of
his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his
expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you
did not enjoy it. You are not going to be&#160;<em>missish</em>, I
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in
our turn?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!"</p>
<p>"Yes—<em>that</em>&#160;is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed
on any other man it would have been nothing;
but&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;perfect indifference,
and&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;pointed dislike, make it so
delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give
up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I
read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even
over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my
son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this
report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"</p>
<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as
it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not
distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a
loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was
necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father
had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's
indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of
penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too
little, she might have fancied too much.</p>
