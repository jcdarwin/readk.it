<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>r. Collins was
not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but
little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his
life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities,
he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any
useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought
him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it
was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak
head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early
and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him
to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant;
and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration
for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of
himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a
rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness,
self-importance and humility.</p>
<p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he
intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the
Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one
of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they
were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of
atonement—for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it
an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and
excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.</p>
<p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of
what was due to seniority; and for the first
evening&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;was his settled choice. The next
morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's
tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation
beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the
avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and
general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed
on. "As to her&#160;<em>younger</em>&#160;daughters, she could not
take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did
not&#160;<em>know</em>&#160;of any prepossession;
her&#160;<em>eldest</em>&#160;daughter, she must just mention—she
felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon
engaged."</p>
<p>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was
soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth,
equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of
course.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might
soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not
bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good
graces.</p>
<p>Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every
sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to
attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to
get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr.
Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would
continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the
collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little
cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings
discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he
told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room
of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility,
therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his
daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better
fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close
his large book, and go.</p>
<p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of
his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The
attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by
him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in
quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet
indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall
them.</p>
<p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,
whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance,
walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The
officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London
Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck
with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty
and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across
the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite
shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two
gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny
addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his
friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from
town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their
corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance
was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a
fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The
introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of
conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking
together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their
notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On
distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came
directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was
the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He
was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire
after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning
to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were
suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each
other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both
changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after
a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was
impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.</p>
<p>In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have
noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.</p>
<p>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the
door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of
Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even
in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and
loudly seconding the invitation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two
eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and
she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return
home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should
have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr.
Jones's shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not
to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets
were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins
by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with her very best
politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for
his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he
could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by
his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her
notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an
end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew,
that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have
a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him
the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and
had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have
continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now
except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger,
were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to
dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to
make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation
also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This
was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a
nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of
hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very
cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins
repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with
unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.</p>
<p>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen
pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended
either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no
more explain such behaviour than her sister.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by
admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that,
except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more
elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost
civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the
next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he
supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet
he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his
life.</p>
