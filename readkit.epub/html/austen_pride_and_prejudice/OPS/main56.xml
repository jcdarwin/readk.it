<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s soon as they
were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other
words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must
deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed
her.</p>
<p>"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"
said she, "did he come at all?"</p>
<p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</p>
<p>"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and
aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why
come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,
teasing, man! I will think no more about him."</p>
<p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the
approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which
showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel
perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be
embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on
Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet
only as common and indifferent acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh,
Jane, take care."</p>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger
now?"</p>
<p>"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in
love with you as ever."</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes,
which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an
hour's visit, had revived.</p>
<p>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and
the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their
punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they
repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see
whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former
parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,
occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by
herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane
happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He
placed himself by her.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his
friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have
imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had
she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an
expression of half-laughing alarm.</p>
<p>His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as
showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than
formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,
Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though
she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received
pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the
animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful
humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could
divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either
appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their
discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other,
and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her
mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more
painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given
anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither
unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.</p>
<p>She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity
of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not
pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of
conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his
entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the
drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to
a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their
entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the
evening must depend.</p>
<p>"If he does not come to me,&#160;<em>then</em>," said she, "I
shall give him up for ever."</p>
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would
have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round
the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring
out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a
single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the
gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than
ever, and said, in a whisper:</p>
<p>"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none
of them; do we?"</p>
<p>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed
him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely
patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged
against herself for being so silly!</p>
<p>"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish
enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex,
who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal
to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their
feelings!"</p>
<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his
coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:</p>
<p>"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."</p>
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to
Scarborough, these three weeks."</p>
<p>She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to
converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her,
however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young
lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.</p>
<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed,
the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon
joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him
fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a
few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost
every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening
at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes
were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him
play as unsuccessfully as herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen
to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of
the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.</p>
<p>"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,
"What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off
uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as
any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody
said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times
better than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr.
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done;
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my
dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said
so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think
she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at
Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as
good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty
behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them
prodigiously."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen
enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she
would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her
family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she
was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day,
to make his proposals.</p>
<p>"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to
Elizabeth. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with
the other. I hope we may often meet again."</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It
mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his
conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having
a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners
now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It
is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a
stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."</p>
<p>"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me
smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."</p>
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"</p>
<p>"And how impossible in others!"</p>
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"</p>
<p>"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all
love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth
knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not
make me your confidante."</p>
