The Shark Massacre</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>When in the Southern Fishery a captured Sperm Whale, after long
and weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a
general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the
business of cutting him in. For that business is an exceedingly
laborious one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands
to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in all
sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send every one below to his
hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,
anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour,
each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that
all goes well.</p>
<p>But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this
plan will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of
sharks gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for
six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would
be visible by morning. In most other parts of the ocean, however,
where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity
can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring
them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding,
which, in some instances, only seems to tickle them into still
greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the
Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such
sights, to have looked over her side that night, would have almost
thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks
the maggots in it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his
supper was concluded; and when, accordingly Queequeg and a
forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created
among the sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages
over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long
gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting
their long whaling-spades,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_13" id=
"footnote_13_call">[13]</a>&#160;kept up an incessant murdering of
the sharks, by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls,
seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of
their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit
their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at
each other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round,
and bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and
over again by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping
wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses
and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic
vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after what
might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and
hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks
almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried to shut down
the dead lid of his murderous jaw.</p>
<p>“Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,
agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or
Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam
Ingin.”</p>
