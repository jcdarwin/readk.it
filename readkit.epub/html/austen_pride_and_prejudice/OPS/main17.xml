<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth related
to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and
herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not
how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's
regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity
of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to
be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of
each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever
could not be otherwise explained.</p>
<p>"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some
way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have
perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,
impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which
may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."</p>
<p>"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to
say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been
concerned in the business? Do clear&#160;<em>them</em>&#160;too, or
we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."</p>
<p>"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of
my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful
light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in
such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It
is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value
for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate
friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."</p>
<p>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on,
than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he
gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without
ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,
there was truth in his looks."</p>
<p>"It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know
what to think."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."</p>
<p>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr.
Bingley, if he&#160;<em>had</em>&#160;been imposed on, would have
much to suffer when the affair became public.</p>
<p>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where
this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of
whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to
give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at
Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two
ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an
age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been
doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the
family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as
possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the
others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as
if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.</p>
<p>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to
every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as
given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly
flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,
instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy
evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of
her brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great
deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything
in Mr. Darcy's look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by
Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any
particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to
dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the
only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a
ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no
disinclination for it.</p>
<p>"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is
enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening
engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one
of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as
desirable for everybody."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though
she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not
help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's
invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join
in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find
that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very
far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.</p>
<p>"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that
a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to
respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far
from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured
with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening;
and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth,
for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my
cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any
disrespect for her."</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully
proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to
have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse
timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness
and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.
Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She
was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it
suggested of something more. It now first struck her,
that&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;was selected from among her sisters as
worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to
form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible
visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his
increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent
attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more
astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it
was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the
probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable
to&#160;<em>her</em>. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take
the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer,
and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</p>
<p>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk
of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable
state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day
of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their
walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be
sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in
weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance
with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could
have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to
Kitty and Lydia.</p>
