<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ill Elizabeth
entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr.
Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of
his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more
than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the
conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that
it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But
in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely
omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the
officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute
fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom
Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been
obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet
returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his
business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted
to avoid a certain gentleman here."</p>
<p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was
caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less
answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been
just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so
sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply
with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly
afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience
with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any
sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of
ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to
Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to
Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon
able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin,
and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two
dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of
mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead
of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it,
gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for
a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was
ecstasy.</p>
<p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of
talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.
When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and
was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly
addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his
application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she
accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to
fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to
console her:</p>
<p>"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."</p>
<p>"Heaven forbid!&#160;<em>That</em>&#160;would be the greatest
misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined
to hate! Do not wish me such an evil."</p>
<p>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to
claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a
whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to
make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his
consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the
set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being
allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her
neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They
stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and
at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that
it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to
talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied,
and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed
him a second time with:—"It is&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;turn to say
something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance,
and&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;ought to make some sort of remark on the
size of the room, or the number of couples."</p>
<p>He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say
should be said.</p>
<p>"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and
by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones. But&#160;<em>now</em>&#160;we may be silent."</p>
<p>"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd
to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the
advantage of&#160;<em>some</em>, conversation ought to be so
arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as
possible."</p>
<p>"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do
you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"</p>
<p>"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a
great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an
unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we
expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be
handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."</p>
<p>"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I
am sure," said he. "How near it may be to&#160;<em>mine</em>, I
cannot pretend to say.&#160;<em>You</em>&#160;think it a faithful
portrait undoubtedly."</p>
<p>"I must not decide on my own performance."</p>
<p>He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone
down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not
very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,
unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the
other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."</p>
<p>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade
of&#160;<em>hauteur</em>&#160;overspread his features, but he said
not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own
weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy
manners as may ensure his&#160;<em>making</em>&#160;friends—whether
he may be equally capable of&#160;<em>retaining</em>&#160;them, is
less certain."</p>
<p>"He has been so unlucky as to
lose&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;friendship," replied Elizabeth with
emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."</p>
<p>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the
subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them,
meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but
on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy
to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.</p>
<p>"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such
very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you
belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your
fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have
this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable
event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall
take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr.
Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for
detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady,
whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."</p>
<p>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but
Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,
and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards
Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself,
however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir
William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking
of."</p>
<p>"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not
have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."</p>
<p>"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.</p>
<p>"Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the
same feelings."</p>
<p>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at
least be no want of subject. We may compare our different
opinions."</p>
<p>"No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always
full of something else."</p>
<p>"The&#160;<em>present</em>&#160;always occupies you in such
scenes—does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.</p>
<p>"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for
her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards
appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once
say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment
once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as
to its&#160;<em>being created</em>."</p>
<p>"I am," said he, with a firm voice.</p>
<p>"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"</p>
<p>"I hope not."</p>
<p>"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their
opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."</p>
<p>"May I ask to what these questions tend?"</p>
<p>"Merely to the illustration
of&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;character," said she, endeavouring to
shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."</p>
<p>"And what is your success?"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such
different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."</p>
<p>"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may
vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,
that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as
there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no
credit on either."</p>
<p>"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have
another opportunity."</p>
<p>"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly
replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and
parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an
equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful
feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed
all his anger against another.</p>
<p>They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,
and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:</p>
<p>"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking
me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot
to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of
old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you,
however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his
assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly
false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to
him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous
manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that
Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear
George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that
he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the
officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most
insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's
guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect
much better."</p>
<p>"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the
same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of
nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and
of&#160;<em>that</em>, I can assure you, he informed me
himself."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a
sneer. "Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant."</p>
<p>"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much
mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as
this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the
malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who has
undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane
met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such
happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied
with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her
feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment
against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope
of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.</p>
<p>"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling
than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But
perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third
person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."</p>
<p>"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have
nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the
whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances
which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for
the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is
perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less
attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to
say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no
means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very
imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."</p>
<p>"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"</p>
<p>"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."</p>
<p>"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"</p>
<p>"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has
heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it
was left to him&#160;<em>conditionally</em>&#160;only."</p>
<p>"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth
warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances
only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I
dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the
story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall
venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."</p>
<p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,
and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth
listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane
entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to
heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley
himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after
the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied,
before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great
exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most
important discovery.</p>
<p>"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there
is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to
overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who
does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de
Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these
sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,
perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I
am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay
my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will
excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the
connection must plead my apology."</p>
<p>"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"</p>
<p>"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it
earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's&#160;<em>nephew</em>.
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite
well yesterday se'nnight."</p>
<p>Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme,
assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him
without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a
compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary
there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it
must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the
acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air
of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,
replied thus:</p>
<p>"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world
in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the
laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to
observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of
dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper
humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must
therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this
occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of
duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on
every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case
before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual
study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself."
And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception
of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech
with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she
felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It
vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was
eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins
allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and
Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length
of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a
slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied
with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the
attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid
me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady
Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a
favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the
whole, I am much pleased with him."</p>
<p>As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue,
she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.
Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her
observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as
Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the
felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she
felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to
like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw
were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,
therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to
find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)
freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane
would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject,
and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the
advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and
so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first
points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think
how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they
must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was,
moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich
men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able
to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It
was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure,
because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less
likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any
period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady
Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and
triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.</p>
<p>In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her
mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less
audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could
perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat
opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being
nonsensical.</p>
<p>"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged
to say nothing&#160;<em>he</em>&#160;may not like to hear."</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be
for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to
his friend by so doing!"</p>
<p>Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her
mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She
could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though
every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was
not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his
attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face
changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady
gravity.</p>
<p>At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady
Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights
which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of
cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long
was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,
singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing
Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour
to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would
not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was
delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were
fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was
very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst
the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a
display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was
in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane
was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two
sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and
at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked
at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be
singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her
second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You
have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time
to exhibit."</p>
<p>Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;
and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech,
was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were
now applied to.</p>
<p>"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to
sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the
company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent
diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be
justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are
certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish
has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement
for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his
patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains
will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and
improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light
importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner
towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his
preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think
well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his
respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow
to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so
loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but
no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife
seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and
observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.</p>
<p>To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement
to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it
would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more
spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and
her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and
that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the
folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr.
Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her
relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the
silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the
ladies, were more intolerable.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was
teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her
side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him
again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did
she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to
introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that
as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief
object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and
that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the
whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined
them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to
herself.</p>
<p>She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further
notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her,
quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it
to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and
rejoiced in it.</p>
<p>The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,
and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage
a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them
time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the
family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths,
except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have
the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet
at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole
party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr.
Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the
elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness
which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the
scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little
detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth
preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley;
and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the
occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a
violent yawn.</p>
<p>When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most
pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at
Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to
assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner
with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.
Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for
taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return
from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short
time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under
the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary
preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,
she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in
the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter
married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with
considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least
dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match
were quite good enough for&#160;<em>her</em>, the worth of each was
eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</p>
