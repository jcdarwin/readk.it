<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he next day
opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration
in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his
leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and
having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself
even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with
all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the
business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger
girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in
these words:</p>
<p>"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter
Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with
her in the course of this morning?"</p>
<p>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,
Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure
Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come,
Kitty, I want you upstairs." And, gathering her work together, she
was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:</p>
<p>"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must
excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not
hear. I am going away myself."</p>
<p>"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are."
And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed
looks, about to escape, she added: "Lizzy,
I&#160;<em>insist</em>&#160;upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins."</p>
<p>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to
get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again
and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which
were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty
walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.</p>
<p>"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far
from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other
perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had
there&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;been this little unwillingness; but
allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's
permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my
discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble;
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon
as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my
future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons
for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the
design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."</p>
<p>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being
run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing,
that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to
stop him further, and he continued:</p>
<p>"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right
thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to
set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am
convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and
thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is
the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady
whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she
condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject;
and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins,
you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly,
choose a gentlewoman for&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;sake; and for
your&#160;<em>own</em>, let her be an active, useful sort of
person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a
good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can,
bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way,
to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must
be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my
general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why
my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own
neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young
women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate
after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live
many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to
choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might
be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes
place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for
several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of
the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly
indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your
father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with;
and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not
be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever
be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly
silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach
shall ever pass my lips when we are married."</p>
<p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</p>
<p>"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have
made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept
my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible
of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do
otherwise than to decline them."</p>
<p>"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave
of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the
addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he
first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is
repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means
discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you
to the altar ere long."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am
not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who
are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being
asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You
could not make&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;happy, and I am convinced that
I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were
your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would
find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."</p>
<p>"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr.
Collins very gravely—"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would
at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the
honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms
of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."</p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and
by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being
otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the
delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take
possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any
self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally
settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the
room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:</p>
<p>"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the
subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you
have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at
present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex
to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even
now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with
the true delicacy of the female character."</p>
<p>"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you
puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to
you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my
refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."</p>
<p>"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that
your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons
for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that
my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I
can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in
life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my
relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour;
and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of
your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another
offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily
so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your
loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude
that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to
attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense,
according to the usual practice of elegant females."</p>
<p>"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to
that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable
man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed
sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done
me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.
My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not
consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but
as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart."</p>
<p>"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not
fail of being acceptable."</p>
<p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would
make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined,
if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be
uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behavior at
least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an
elegant female.</p>
