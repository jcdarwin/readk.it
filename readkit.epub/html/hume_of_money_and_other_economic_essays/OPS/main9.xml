<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T appears to have
been the common practice of antiquity, to make provision, during
peace, for the necessities of war, and to hoard up treasures
before-hand, as the instruments either of conquest or defence;
without trusting to extraordinary impositions, much less to
borrowing, in times of disorder and confusion. Besides the immense
sums above mentioned,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_34" id="footnote_34_call">[34]</a> which
were amassed by Athens, and by the Ptolemies, and other successors
of Alexander; we learn from Plato,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_35" id="footnote_35_call">[35]</a> that the
frugal Lacedemonians had also collected a great treasure; and
Arrian<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_36" id=
"footnote_36_call">[36]</a> and Plutarch<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_37" id="footnote_37_call">[37]</a> take
notice of the riches which Alexander got possession of on the
conquest of Susa and Ecbatana, and which were reserved, some of
them, from the time of Cyrus. If I remember right, the scripture
also mentions the treasure of Hezekiah and the Jewish princes; as
profane history does that of Philip and Perseus, kings of Macedon.
The ancient republics of Gaul had commonly large sums in
reserve.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_38" id=
"footnote_38_call">[38]</a> Every one knows the treasure seized in
Rome by Julius Caesar, during the civil wars: and we find
afterwards, that the wiser emperors, Augustus, Tiberius, Vespasian,
Severus, &amp;c. always discovered the prudent foresight, of saving
great sums against any public exigency.</p>
<p>On the contrary, our modern expedient, which has become very
general, is to mortgage the public revenues, and to trust that
posterity will pay off the incumbrances contracted by their
ancestors: And they, having before their eyes, so good an example
of their wise fathers, have the same prudent reliance on
<em>their</em> posterity; who, at last, from necessity more than
choice, are obliged to place the same confidence in a new
posterity. But not to waste time in declaiming against a practice
which appears ruinous, beyond all controversy; it seems pretty
apparent, that the ancient maxims are, in this respect, more
prudent than the modern; even though the latter had been confined
within some reasonable bounds, and had ever, in any instance, been
attended with such frugality, in time of peace, as to discharge the
debts incurred by an expensive war. For why should the case be so
different between the public and an individual, as to make us
establish different maxims of conduct for each? If the funds of the
former be greater, its necessary expences are proportionably
larger; if its resources be more numerous, they are not infinite;
and as its frame should be calculated for a much longer duration
than the date of a single life, or even of a family, it should
embrace maxims, large, durable, and generous, agreeably to the
supposed extent of its existence. To trust to chances and temporary
expedients, is, indeed, what the necessity of human affairs
frequently renders unavoidable; but whoever voluntarily depend on
such resources, have not necessity, but their own folly, to accuse
for their misfortunes, when any such befal them.</p>
<p>If the abuses of treasures be dangerous, either by engaging the
state in rash enterprizes, or making it neglect military
discipline, in confidence of its riches; the abuses of mortgaging
are more certain and inevitable; poverty, impotence, and subjection
to foreign powers.</p>
<p>According to modern policy war is attended with every
destructive circumstance; loss of men, encrease of taxes, decay of
commerce, dissipation of money, devastation by sea and land.
According to ancient maxims, the opening of the public treasure, as
it produced an uncommon affluence of gold and silver, served as a
temporary encouragement to industry, and atoned, in some degree,
for the inevitable calamities of war.</p>
<p>It is very tempting to a minister to employ such an expedient,
as enables him to make a great figure during his administration,
without overburthening the people with taxes, or exciting any
immediate clamours against himself. The practice, therefore, of
contracting debt will almost infallibly be abused, in every
government. It would scarcely be more imprudent to give a prodigal
son a credit in every banker’s shop in London, than to impower a
statesman to draw bills, in this manner, upon posterity.</p>
<p>What then shall we say to the new paradox, that public
incumbrances, are, of themselves, advantageous, independent of the
necessity of contracting them; and that any state, even though it
were not pressed by a foreign enemy, could not possibly have
embraced a wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches, than
to create funds, and debts, and taxes, without limitation?
Reasonings, such as these, might naturally have passed for trials
of wit among rhetoricians, like the panegyrics on folly and a
fever, on Busiris and Nero, had we not seen such absurd maxims
patronized by great ministers, and by a whole party among us.</p>
<p>Let us examine the consequences of public debts, both in our
domestic management, by their influence on commerce and industry;
and in our foreign transactions, by their effect on wars and
negociations.</p>
<p>Public securities are with us become a kind of money, and pass
as readily at the current price as gold or silver. Wherever any
profitable undertaking offers itself, how expensive soever, there
are never wanting hands enow to embrace it; nor need a trader, who
has sums in the public stocks, fear to launch out into the most
extensive trade; since he is possessed of funds, which will answer
the most sudden demand that can be made upon him. No merchant
thinks it necessary to keep by him any considerable cash.
Bank-stock, or India-bonds, especially the latter, serve all the
same purposes; because he can dispose of them, or pledge them to a
banker, in a quarter of an hour; and at the same time they are not
idle, even when in his scritoire, but bring him in a constant
revenue. In short, our national debts furnish merchants with a
species of money, that is continually multiplying in their hands,
and produces sure gain, besides the profits of their commerce. This
must enable them to trade upon less profit. The small profit of the
merchant renders the commodity cheaper, causes a greater
consumption, quickens the labour of the common people, and helps to
spread arts and industry throughout the whole society.</p>
<p>There are also, we may observe, in England and in all states,
which have both commerce and public debts, a set of men, who are
half merchants, half stock-holders, and may be supposed willing to
trade for small profits; because commerce is not their principal or
sole support, and their revenues in the funds are a sure resource
for themselves and their families. Were there no funds, great
merchants would have no expedient for realizing or securing any
part of their profit, but by making purchases of land; and land has
many disadvantages in comparison of funds. Requiring more care and
inspection, it divides the time and attention of the merchant; upon
any tempting offer or extraordinary accident in trade, it is not so
easily converted into money; and as it attracts too much, both by
the many natural pleasures it affords, and the authority it gives,
it soon converts the citizen into the country gentleman. More men,
therefore, with large stocks and incomes, may naturally be supposed
to continue in trade, where there are public debts; and this, it
must be owned, is of some advantage to commerce, by diminishing its
profits, promoting circulation, and encouraging industry.</p>
<p>But, in opposition to these two favourable circumstances,
perhaps of no very great importance, weigh the many disadvantages
which attend our public debts, in the whole interior œconomy of the
state: You will find no comparison between the ill and the good
which result from them.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, It is certain, that national debts cause a
mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital, by the great
sums, levied in the provinces to pay the interest; and perhaps,
too, by the advantages in trade above mentioned, which they give
the merchants in the capital above the rest of the kingdom. The
question is, whether, in our case, it be for the public interest,
that so many privileges should be conferred on London, which has
already arrived at such an enormous size, and seems still
encreasing? Some men are apprehensive of the consequences. For my
own part, I cannot forbear thinking, that, though the head is
undoubtedly too large for the body, yet that great city is so
happily situated, that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience
than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom. There is more
difference between the prices of all provisions in Paris and
Languedoc, than between those in London and Yorkshire. The immense
greatness, indeed, of London, under a government which admits not
of discretionary power, renders the people factious, mutinous,
seditious, and even perhaps rebellious. But to this evil the
national debts themselves tend to provide a remedy. The first
visible eruption, or even immediate danger, of public disorders
must alarm all the stockholders, whose property is the most
precarious of any; and will make them fly to the support of
government, whether menaced by Jacobitish violence or democratical
frenzy.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, Public stocks, being a kind of paper-credit,
have all the disadvantages attending that species of money. They
banish gold and silver from the most considerable commerce of the
state, reduce them to common circulation, and by that means render
all provisions and labour dearer than otherwise they would be.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly</em>, The taxes, which are levied to pay the
interests of these debts, are apt either to heighten the price of
labour, or be an oppression on the poorer sort.</p>
<p><em>Fourthly</em>, As foreigners possess a great share of our
national funds, they render the public, in a manner, tributary to
them, and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our
industry.</p>
<p><em>Fifthly</em>, The greater part of the public stock being
always in the hands of idle people, who live on their revenue, our
funds, in that view, give great encouragement to an useless and
unactive life.</p>
<p>But though the injury, that arises to commerce and industry from
our public funds, will appear, upon balancing the whole, not
inconsiderable, it is trivial, in comparison of the prejudice that
results to the state considered as a body politic, which must
support itself in the society of nations, and have various
transactions with other states in wars and negociations. The ill,
there, is pure and unmixed, without any favourable circumstance to
atone for it; and it is an ill too of a nature the highest and most
important.</p>
<p>We have, indeed, been told, that the public is no weaker upon
account of its debts; since they are mostly due among ourselves,
and bring as much property to one as they take from another. It is
like transferring money from the right hand to the left; which
leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before. Such loose
reasonings and specious comparisons will always pass, where we
judge not upon principles. I ask, Is it possible, in the nature of
things, to overburthen a nation with taxes, even where the
sovereign resides among them? The very doubt seems extravagant;
since it is requisite, in every community, that there be a certain
proportion observed between the laborious and the idle part of it.
But if all our present taxes be mortgaged, must we not invent new
ones? And may not this matter be carried to a length that is
ruinous and destructive?</p>
<p>In every nation, there are always some methods of levying money
more easy than others, agreeably to the way of living of the
people, and the commodities they make use of. In Great Britain, the
excises upon malt and beer afford a large revenue; because the
operations of malting and brewing are tedious, and are impossible
to be concealed; and at the same time, these commodities are not so
absolutely necessary to life, as that the raising of their price
would very much affect the poorer sort. These taxes being all
mortgaged, what difficulty to find new ones! what vexation and ruin
of the poor!</p>
<p>Duties upon consumptions are more equal and easy than those upon
possessions. What a loss to the public, that the former are all
exhausted, and that we must have recourse to the more grievous
method of levying taxes!</p>
<p>Were all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public,
must not necessity force them to practise all the arts of
oppression used by stewards; where the absence or negligence of the
proprietor render them secure against enquiry?</p>
<p>It will scarcely be asserted, that no bounds ought ever to be
set to national debts; and that the public would be no weaker, were
twelve or fifteen shillings in the pound, land-tax, mortgaged, with
all the present customs and excises. There is something, therefore,
in the case, beside the mere transferring of property from the one
hand to another. In 500 years, the posterity of those now in the
coaches, and of those upon the boxes, will probably have changed
places, without affecting the public by these revolutions.</p>
<p>Suppose the public once fairly brought to that condition, to
which it is hastening with such amazing rapidity; suppose the land
to be taxed eighteen or nineteen shillings in the pound; for it can
never bear the whole twenty; suppose all the excises and customs to
be screwed up to the utmost which the nation can bear, without
entirely losing its commerce and industry; and suppose that all
those funds are mortgaged to perpetuity, and that the invention and
wit of all our projectors can find no new imposition, which may
serve as the foundation of a new loan; and let us consider the
necessary consequences of this situation. Though the imperfect
state of our political knowledge, and the narrow capacities of men,
make it difficult to fortel the effects which will result from any
untried measure, the seeds of ruin are here scattered with such
profusion as not to escape the eye of the most careless
observer.</p>
<p>In this unnatural state of society, the only persons, who
possess any revenue beyond the immediate effects of their industry,
are the stock-holders, who draw almost all the rent of the land and
houses, besides the produce of all the customs and excises. These
are men, who have no connexions with the state, who can enjoy their
revenue in any part of the globe in which they chuse to reside, who
will naturally bury themselves in the capital or in great cities,
and who will sink into the lethargy of a stupid and pampered
luxury, without spirit, ambition, or enjoyment. Adieu to all ideas
of nobility, gentry, and family. The stocks can be transferred in
an instant, and being in such a fluctuating state, will seldom be
transmitted during three generations from father to son. Or were
they to remain ever so long in one family, they convey no
hereditary authority or credit to the possessor; and by this means,
the several ranks of men, which form a kind of independent
magistracy in a state, instituted by the hand of nature, are
entirely lost; and every man in authority derives his influence
from the commission alone of the sovereign. No expedient remains
for preventing or suppressing insurrections, but mercenary armies:
No expedient at all remains for resisting tyranny: Elections are
swayed by bribery and corruption alone: And the middle power
between king and people being totally removed, a grievous despotism
must infallibly prevail. The landholders, despised for their
poverty, and hated for their oppressions, will be utterly unable to
make any opposition to it.</p>
<p>Though a resolution should be formed by the legislature never to
impose any tax which hurts commerce and discourages industry, it
will be impossible for men, in subjects of such extreme delicacy,
to reason so justly as never to be mistaken, or amidst difficulties
so urgent, never to be seduced from their resolution. The continual
fluctuations in commerce require continual alterations in the
nature of the taxes; which exposes the legislature every moment to
the danger both of wilful and involuntary error. And any great blow
given to trade, whether by injudicious taxes or by other accidents,
throws the whole system of government into confusion.</p>
<p>But what expedient can the public now employ, even supposing
trade to continue in the most flourishing condition, in order to
support its foreign wars and enterprizes, and to defend its own
honour and interests, or those of its allies? I do not ask how the
public is to exert such a prodigious power as it has maintained
during our late wars; where we have so much exceeded, not only our
own natural strength, but even that of the greatest empires. This
extravagance is the abuse complained of, as the source of all the
dangers, to which we are at present exposed. But since we must
still suppose great commerce and opulence to remain, even after
every fund is mortgaged; these riches must be defended by
proportional power; and whence is the public to derive the revenue
which supports it? It must plainly be from a continual taxation of
the annuitants, or, which is the same thing, from mortgaging anew,
on every exigency, a certain part of their annuities; and thus
making them contribute to their own defence, and to that of the
nation. But the difficulties, attending this system of policy, will
easily appear, whether we suppose the king to have become absolute
master, or to be still controuled by national councils, in which
the annuitants themselves must necessarily bear the principal
sway.</p>
<p>If the prince has become absolute, as may naturally be expected
from this situation of affairs, it is so easy for him to encrease
his exactions upon the annuitants, which amount only to the
retaining money in his own hands, that this species of property
would soon lose all its credit, and the whole income of every
individual in the state must lie entirely at the mercy of the
sovereign: A degree of despotism, which no oriental monarchy has
ever yet attained. If, on the contrary, the consent of the
annuitants be requisite for every taxation, they will never be
persuaded to contribute sufficiently even to the support of
government; as the diminution of their revenue must in that case be
very sensible, would not be disguised under the appearance of a
branch of excise or customs, and would not be shared by any other
order of the state, who are already supposed to be taxed to the
utmost. There are instances, in some republics, of a hundredth
penny, and sometimes of the fiftieth, being given to the support of
the state; but this is always an extraordinary exertion of power,
and can never become the foundation of a constant national defence.
We have always found, where a government has mortgaged all its
revenues, that it necessarily sinks into a state of languor,
inactivity, and impotence.</p>
<p>Such are the inconveniencies, which may reasonably be foreseen,
of this situation, to which Great Britain is visibly tending. Not
to mention, the numberless inconveniencies, which cannot be
foreseen, and which must result from so monstrous a situation as
that of making the public the chief or sole proprietor of land,
besides investing it with every branch of customs and excise, which
the fertile imagination of ministers and projectors have been able
to invent.</p>
<p>I must confess, that there is a strange supineness, from long
custom, creeped into all ranks of men, with regard to public debts,
not unlike what divines so vehemently complain of with regard to
their religious doctrines. We all own, that the most sanguine
imagination cannot hope, either that this or any future ministry
will be possessed of such rigid and steady frugality, as to make a
considerable progress in the payment of our debts; or that the
situation of foreign affairs will, for any long time, allow them
leisure and tranquillity for such an undertaking. <em>What then is
to become of us?</em> Were we ever so good Christians, and ever so
resigned to Providence; this, methinks, were a curious question,
even considered as a speculative one, and what it might not be
altogether impossible to form some conjectural solution of. The
events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles,
negociations, intrigues, and factions. There seems to be a natural
progress of things, which may guide our reasoning. As it would have
required but a moderate share of prudence, when we first began this
practice of mortgaging, to have foretold, from the nature of men
and of ministers, that things would necessarily be carried to the
length we see; so now, that they have at last happily reached it,
it may not be difficult to guess at the consequences. It must,
indeed, be one of these two events; either the nation must destroy
public credit, or public credit will destroy the nation. It is
impossible that they can both subsist, after the manner they have
been hitherto managed, in this, as well as in some other
countries.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, a scheme for the payment of our debts, which
was proposed by an excellent citizen, Mr. Hutchinson, above thirty
years ago, and which was much approved of by some men of sense, but
never was likely to take effect. He asserted, that there was a
fallacy in imagining that the public owed this debt; for that
really every individual owed a proportional share of it, and paid,
in his taxes, a proportional share of the interest, beside the
expence of levying these taxes. Had we not better, then, says he,
make a distribution of the debt among ourselves, and each of us
contribute a sum suitable to his property, and by that means
discharge at once all our funds and public mortgages? He seems not
to have considered, that the laborious poor pay a considerable part
of the taxes by their annual consumptions, though they could not
advance, at once, a proportional part of the sum required. Not to
mention, that property in money and stock in trade might easily be
concealed or disguised; and that visible property in lands and
houses would really at last answer for the whole: An inequality and
oppression, which never would be submitted to. But though this
project is not likely to take place; it is not altogether
improbable, that, when the nation becomes heartily sick of their
debts, and is cruelly oppressed by them, some daring projector may
arise with visionary schemes for their discharge. And as public
credit will begin, by that time, to be a little frail, the least
touch will destroy it, as happened in France during the regency;
and in this manner it will <em>die of the doctor</em>.</p>
<p>But it is more probable, that the breach of national faith will
be the necessary effect of wars, defeats, misfortunes, and public
calamities, or even perhaps of victories and conquests. I must
confess, when I see princes and states fighting and quarrelling,
amidst their debts, funds, and public mortgages, it always brings
to my mind a match of cudgel-playing fought in a <em>China</em>
shop. How can it be expected, that sovereigns will spare a species
of property, which is pernicious to themselves and to the public,
when they have so little compassion on lives and properties, that
are useful to both? Let the time come (and surely it will come)
when the new funds, created for the exigencies of the year, are not
subscribed to, and raise not the money projected. Suppose, either
that the cash of the nation is exhausted; or that our faith, which
has hitherto been so ample, begins to fail us. Suppose, that, in
this distress, the nation is threatened with an invasion; a
rebellion is suspected or broken out at home; a squadron cannot be
equipped for want of pay, victuals, or repairs; or even a foreign
subsidy cannot be advanced. What must a prince or minister do in
such an emergence? The right of self-preservation is unalienable in
every individual, much more in every community. And the folly of
our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who
first contracted debt, or, what is more, than that of those who
trusted, or continue to trust this security, if these statesmen
have the means of safety in their hands, and do not employ them.
The funds, created and mortgaged, will, by that time, bring in a
large yearly revenue, sufficient for the defence and security of
the nation: Money is perhaps lying in the exchequer, ready for the
discharge of the quarterly interest: Necessity calls, fear urges,
reason exhorts, compassion alone exclaims: The money will
immediately be seized for the current service, under the most
solemn protestations, perhaps, of being immediately replaced. But
no more is requisite. The whole fabric, already tottering, falls to
the ground, and buries thousands in its ruins. And this, I think,
may be called the <em>natural death</em> of public credit: For to
this period it tends as naturally as an animal body to its
dissolution and destruction.</p>
<p>So great dupes are the generality of mankind, that,
notwithstanding such a violent shock to public credit, as a
voluntary bankruptcy in England would occasion, it would not
probably be long ere credit would again revive in as flourishing a
condition as before. The present king of France, during the late
war, borrowed money at lower interest than ever his grandfather
did; and as low as the British parliament, comparing the natural
rate of interest in both kingdoms. And though men are commonly more
governed by what they have seen, than by what they foresee, with
whatever certainty; yet promises, protestations, fair appearances,
with the allurements of present interest, have such powerful
influence as few are able to resist. Mankind are, in all ages,
caught by the same baits: The same tricks, played over and over
again, still trepan them. The heights of popularity and patriotism
are still the beaten road to power and tyranny; flattery to
treachery; standing armies to arbitrary government; and the glory
of God to the temporal interest of the clergy. The fear of an
everlasting destruction of credit, allowing it to be an evil, is a
needless bugbear. A prudent man, in reality, would rather lend to
the public immediately after we had taken a spunge to our debts,
than at present; as much as an opulent knave, even though one could
not force him to pay, is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt:
For the former, in order to carry on business, may find it his
interest to discharge his debts, where they are not exorbitant: The
latter has it not in his power. The reasoning of Tacitus,<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_39" id=
"footnote_39_call">[39]</a> as it is eternally true, is very
applicable to our present case. <em>Sed vulgus ad magnitudinem
beneficiorum aderat: Stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur: Apud
sapientes cassa habebantur, quae neque dari neque accipi, salva
republica, poterant.</em> The public is a debtor, whom no man can
oblige to pay. The only check which the creditors have upon her, is
the interest of preserving credit; an interest, which may easily be
overbalanced by a great debt, and by a difficult and extraordinary
emergence, even supposing that credit irrecoverable. Not to
mention, that a present necessity often forces states into
measures, which are, strictly speaking, against their interest.</p>
<p>These two events, supposed above, are calamitous, but not the
most calamitous. Thousands are thereby sacrificed to the safety of
millions. But we are not without danger, that the contrary event
may take place, and that millions may be sacrificed for ever to the
temporary safety of thousands.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_40" id="footnote_40_call">[40]</a> Our
popular government, perhaps, will render it difficult or dangerous
for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient, as that of
a voluntary bankruptcy. And though the house of Lords be altogether
composed of proprietors of land, and the house of Commons chiefly;
and consequently neither of them can be supposed to have great
property in the funds. Yet the connections of the members may be so
great with the proprietors, as to render them more tenacious of
public faith, than prudence, policy, or even justice, strictly
speaking, requires. And perhaps too, our foreign enemies may be so
politic as to discover, that our safety lies in despair, and may
not, therefore, show the danger, open and barefaced, till it be
inevitable. The balance of power in Europe, our grandfathers, our
fathers, and we, have all deemed too unequal to be preserved
without our attention and assistance. But our children, weary of
the struggle, and fettered with incumbrances, may sit down secure,
and see their neighbours oppressed and conquered; till, at last,
they themselves and their creditors lie both at the mercy of the
conqueror. And this may properly enough be denominated the
<em>violent death</em> of our public credit.</p>
<p>These seem to be the events, which are not very remote, and
which reason foresees as clearly almost as she can do any thing
that lies in the womb of time. And though the ancients maintained,
that in order to reach the gift of prophecy, a certain divine fury
or madness was requisite, one may safely affirm, that, in order to
deliver such prophecies as these, no more is necessary, than merely
to be in one’s senses, free from the influence of popular madness
and delusion.</p>
