the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and
her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her
sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and
the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of
delight.</p>
<p>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye
was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring
it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one
side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had
heard of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to
the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel
hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and
Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the
small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst
the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all
out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs.
Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and
Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found
herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her
cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal
civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out
the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as
they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with
ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated
all his wife's offers of refreshment.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could
not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the
room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself
particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had
lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and
comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of
repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she
could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.
Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned
her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint
blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting
long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from
the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey,
and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to
take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and
to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this
garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth
admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of
the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and
cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the
praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness
which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in
every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the
most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.</p>
<p>From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two
meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains
of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied
him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely
well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it
without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and
convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a
neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the
credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an
air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident
enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.</p>
<p>She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the
country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr.
Collins joining in, observed:</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady
Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not
say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and
condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some
portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any
hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in
every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings
twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her
ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.
I&#160;<em>should</em>&#160;say, one of her ladyship's carriages,
for she has several."</p>
<p>"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"
added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."</p>
<p>"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort
of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."</p>
<p>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire
news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it
closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate
upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address
in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to
acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to
anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual
employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the
gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination
soon settled it all.</p>
<p>About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting
ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole
house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard
somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly
after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place,
who, breathless with agitation, cried out—</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the
dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell
you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."</p>
<p>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing
more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the
lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low
phaeton at the garden gate.</p>
<p>"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that
the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady
Catherine and her daughter."</p>
<p>"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is
not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with
them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a
little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin
and small?"</p>
<p>"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all
this wind. Why does she not come in?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of
favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."</p>
<p>"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other
ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very
well. She will make him a very proper wife."</p>
<p>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation
of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de
Bourgh looked that way.</p>
<p>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove
on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner
saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good
fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the
whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.</p>
