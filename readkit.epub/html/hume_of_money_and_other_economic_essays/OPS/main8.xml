<p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is a
prevailing maxim, among some reasoners, <em>that every new tax
creates a new ability in the subject to bear it, and that each
encrease of public burdens encreases proportionably the industry of
the people</em>. This maxim is of such a nature as is most likely
to be abused; and is so much the more dangerous, as its truth
cannot be altogether denied: but it must be owned, when kept within
certain bounds, to have some foundation in reason and
experience.</p>
<p>When a tax is laid upon commodities, which are consumed by the
common people, the necessary consequence may seem to be, either
that the poor must retrench something from their way of living, or
raise their wages, so as to make the burden of the tax fall
entirely upon the rich. But there is a third consequence, which
often follows upon taxes, namely, that the poor encrease their
industry, perform more work, and live as well as before, without
demanding more for their labour. Where taxes are moderate, are laid
on gradually, and affect not the necessaries of life, this
consequence naturally follows; and it is certain, that such
difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people, and
render them more opulent and laborious, than others, who enjoy the
greatest advantages. For we may observe, as a parallel instance,
that the most commercial nations have not always possessed the
greatest extent of fertile land; but, on the contrary, that they
have laboured under many natural disadvantages. Tyre, Athens,
Carthage, Rhodes, Genoa, Venice, Holland, are strong examples to
this purpose. And in all history, we find only three instances of
large and fertile countries, which have possessed much trade; the
Netherlands, England, and France. The two former seem to have been
allured by the advantages of their maritime situation, and the
necessity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports, in order to
procure what their own climate refused them. And as to France,
trade has come late into that kingdom, and seems to have been the
effect of reflection and observation in an ingenious and
enterprizing people, who remarked the riches acquired by such of
the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigation and commerce.</p>
<p>The places mentioned by Cicero,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_32" id="footnote_32_call">[32]</a> as
possessed of the greatest commerce in his time, are Alexandria,
Colchus, Tyre, Sidon, Andros, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, Rhodes,
Chios, Byzantium, Lesbos, Smyrna, Miletum, Coos. All these, except
Alexandria, were either small islands, or narrow territories. And
that city owed its trade entirely to the happiness of its
situation.</p>
<p>Since therefore some natural necessities or disadvantages may be
thought favourable to industry, why may not artificial burdens have
the same effect? Sir William Temple,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_33" id="footnote_33_call">[33]</a> we may
observe, ascribes the industry of the Dutch entirely to necessity,
proceeding from their natural disadvantages; and illustrates his
doctrine by a striking comparison with Ireland; “where,” says he,
“by the largeness and plenty of the soil, and scarcity of people,
all things necessary to life are so cheap, that an industrious man,
by two days labour, may gain enough to feed him the rest of the
week. Which I take to be a very plain ground of the laziness
attributed to the people. For men naturally prefer ease before
labour, and will not take pains if they can live idle; though when,
by necessity, they have been inured to it, they cannot leave it,
being grown a custom necessary to their health, and to their very
entertainment. Nor perhaps is the change harder, from constant ease
to labour, than from constant labour to ease.” After which the
author proceeds to confirm his doctrine, by enumerating, as above,
the places where trade has most flourished, in ancient and modern
times; and which are commonly observed to be such narrow confined
territories, as beget a necessity for industry.</p>
<p>The best taxes are such as are levied upon consumptions,
especially those of luxury; because such taxes are least felt by
the people. They seem, in some measure, voluntary; since a man may
chuse how far he will use the commodity which is taxed: They are
paid gradually and insensibly: They naturally produce sobriety and
frugality, if judiciously imposed: And being confounded with the
natural price of the commodity, they are scarcely perceived by the
consumers. Their only disadvantage is, that they are expensive in
the levying.</p>
<p>Taxes upon possessions are levied without expence; but have
every other disadvantage. Most states, however, are obliged to have
recourse to them, in order to supply the deficiencies of the
other.</p>
<p>But the most pernicious of all taxes are the arbitrary. They are
commonly converted, by their management, into punishments on
industry; and also, by their unavoidable inequality, are more
grievous, than by the real burden which they impose. It is
surprising, therefore, to see them have place among any civilized
people.</p>
<p>In general, all poll-taxes, even when not arbitrary, which they
commonly are, may be esteemed dangerous: Because it is so easy for
the sovereign to add a little more, and a little more, to the sum
demanded, that these taxes are apt to become altogether oppressive
and intolerable. On the other hand, a duty upon commodities checks
itself; and a prince will soon find, that an encrease of the impost
is no encrease of his revenue. It is not easy, therefore, for a
people to be altogether ruined by such taxes.</p>
<p>Historians inform us, that one of the chief causes of the
destruction of the Roman state, was the alteration, which
Constantine introduced into the finances, by substituting an
universal poll-tax, in lieu of almost all the tithes, customs, and
excises, which formerly composed the revenue of the
<em>empire</em>. The people, in all the provinces, were so grinded
and oppressed by the <em>publicans</em>, that they were glad to
take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians; whose
dominion, as they had fewer necessities and less art, was found
preferable to the refined tyranny of the Romans.</p>
<p>It is an opinion, zealously promoted by some political writers,
that, since all taxes, as they pretend, fall ultimately upon land,
it were better to lay them originally there, and abolish every duty
upon consumptions. But it is denied, that all taxes fall ultimately
upon land. If a duty be laid upon any commodity, consumed by an
artisan, he has two obvious expedients for paying it; he may
retrench somewhat of his expence, or he may encrease his labour.
Both these resources are more easy and natural, than that of
heightening his wages. We see, that, in years of scarcity, the
weaver either consumes less or labours more, or employs both these
expedients of frugality and industry, by which he is enabled to
reach the end of the year. It is but just, that he should subject
himself to the same hardships, if they deserve the name, for the
sake of the publick, which gives him protection. By what
contrivance can he raise the price of his labour? The manufacturer
who employs him, will not give him more: Neither can he, because
the merchant, who exports the cloth, cannot raise its price, being
limited by the price which it yields in foreign markets. Every man,
to be sure, is desirous of pushing off from himself the burden of
any tax, which is imposed, and of laying it upon others: But as
every man has the same inclination, and is upon the defensive; no
set of men can be supposed to prevail altogether in this contest.
And why the landed gentleman should be the victim of the whole, and
should not be able to defend himself, as well as others are, I
cannot readily imagine. All tradesmen, indeed, would willingly prey
upon him, and divide him among them, if they could: But this
inclination they always have, though no taxes were levied; and the
same methods, by which he guards against the imposition of
tradesmen before taxes, will serve him afterwards, and make them
share the burden with him. They must be very heavy taxes, indeed,
and very injudiciously levied, which the artizan will not, of
himself, be enabled to pay, by superior industry and frugality,
without raising the price of his labour.</p>
<p>I shall conclude this subject with observing, that we have, with
regard to taxes, an instance of what frequently happens in
political institutions, that the consequences of things are
diametrically opposite to what we should expect on the first
appearance. It is regarded as a fundamental maxim of the Turkish
government, that the <em>Grand Signior</em>, though absolute master
of the lives and fortunes of each individual, has no authority to
impose a new tax; and every Ottoman prince, who has made such an
attempt, either has been obliged to retract, or has found the fatal
effects of his perseverance. One would imagine, that this prejudice
or established opinion were the firmest barrier in the world
against oppression; yet it is certain, that its effect is quite
contrary. The emperor, having no regular method of encreasing his
revenue, must allow all the bashaws and governors to oppress and
abuse the subjects: And these he squeezes after their return from
their government. Whereas, if he could impose a new tax, like our
European princes, his interest would so far be united with that of
his people, that he would immediately feel the bad effects of these
disorderly levies of money, and would find, that a pound, raised by
a general imposition, would have less pernicious effects, than a
shilling taken in so unequal and arbitrary a manner.</p>
