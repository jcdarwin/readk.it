were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the
post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family
knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for
exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing
intelligence to send; but even of&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;they
would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only
for the letters before he set off.</p>
<p>When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving
constant information of what was going on, and their uncle
promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to
Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his
sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's
not being killed in a duel.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a
few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be
serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she
said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as
she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's
extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving
them more dispirited than she found them.</p>
<p>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three
months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared
to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,
all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into
every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the
wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out
that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,
believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin
more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became
almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if
they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife
received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he
had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to
Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham,
before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory
information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the
principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they
might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,
before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect
any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it,
he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet
seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
effect:</p>
<p>"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be
likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.
If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of
gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.
At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I
dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.
But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what
relations he has now living, better than any other person."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this
deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power
to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the
compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any
relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead
many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions
in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though
she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a
something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most
anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of
letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through
letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be
communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some
news of importance.</p>
<p>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived
for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;
which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for
him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew
what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read
it likewise. It was as follows:</p>
<p>"MY DEAR SIR,</p>
<p>"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my
situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction
you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by
a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your
respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the
bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can
remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate
so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a
circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a
parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a
blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented,
because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me,
that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same
time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am
inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad,
or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.
Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which
opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady
Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They
agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter
will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as
Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me
moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain
event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been
involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you,
dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.</p>
<p>"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer
from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature
to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship
with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had
no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but
since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on
terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one,
therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of
him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a
very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of
discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he
had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in
town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr.
Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the
Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she
cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see
their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he
had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return
to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might
suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs.
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction
as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life
had been before.</p>
<p>"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried.
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to
fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"</p>
<p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled
that she and the children should go to London, at the same time
that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the
first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to
Longbourn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth
and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of
the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before
them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him,
had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return
that could come from Pemberley.</p>
<p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other
excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing,
therefore, could be fairly conjectured from&#160;<em>that</em>,
though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted
with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known
nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy
somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one
sleepless night out of two.</p>
<p>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to
speak of it.</p>
<p>It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,
that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her
briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he
replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has
been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."</p>
<p>"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so
prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how
much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by
the impression. It will pass away soon enough."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose them to be in London?"</p>
<p>"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"</p>
<p>"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.</p>
<p>"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence
there will probably be of some duration."</p>
<p>Then after a short silence he continued:</p>
<p>"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your
advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some
greatness of mind."</p>
<p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her
mother's tea.</p>
<p>"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives
such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I
will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give
as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty
runs away."</p>
<p>"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."</p>
<p>"<em>You</em>&#160;go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near
it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt
to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is
ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the
village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up
with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors
till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in
a rational manner."</p>
<p>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to
cry.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are
a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at
the end of them."</p>
