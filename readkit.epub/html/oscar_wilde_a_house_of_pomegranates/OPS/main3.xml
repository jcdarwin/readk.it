<div class="text">
<p>Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home
through a great pine-forest.&#160; It was winter, and a night of
bitter cold.&#160; The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the
branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on
either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the
Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the
Ice-King had kissed her.</p>
<p>So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know
what to make of it.</p>
<p>‘Ugh!’ snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with
his tail between his legs, ‘this is perfectly monstrous
weather.&#160; Why doesn’t the Government look to it?’</p>
<p>‘Weet! weet! weet!’ twittered the green Linnets, ‘the old Earth
is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.’</p>
<p>‘The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal
dress,’ whispered the Turtle-doves to each other.&#160; Their
little pink feet were quite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was
their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.</p>
<p>‘Nonsense!’ growled the Wolf.&#160; ‘I tell you that it is all
the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall
eat you.’&#160; The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was
never at a loss for a good argument.</p>
<p>‘Well, for my own part,’ said the Woodpecker, who was a born
philosopher, ‘I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.&#160;
If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly
cold.’</p>
<p>Terribly cold it certainly was.&#160; The little Squirrels, who
lived inside the tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to
keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their
holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.&#160; The
only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned
Owls.&#160; Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did
not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out
to each other across the forest, ‘Tu-whit!&#160; Tu-whoo!&#160;
Tu-whit!&#160; Tu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!’</p>
<p>On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their
fingers, and stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the
caked snow.&#160; Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as
white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they
slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh-water was frozen,
and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick
them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that
they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for
they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her
arms.&#160; But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who
watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went
warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and
saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village
in which they dwelt.</p>
<p>So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed
aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and
the Moon like a flower of gold.</p>
<p>Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they
remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, ‘Why
did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for
such as we are?&#160; Better that we had died of cold in the
forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain
us.’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ answered his companion, ‘much is given to some, and
little is given to others.&#160; Injustice has parcelled out the
world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.’</p>
<p>But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this
strange thing happened.&#160; There fell from heaven a very bright
and beautiful star.&#160; It slipped down the side of the sky,
passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it
wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow-trees
that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s-throw
away.</p>
<p>‘Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,’ they
cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the
gold.</p>
<p>And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him,
and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other
side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white
snow.&#160; So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his
hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously
wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.&#160; And he cried
out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen
from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down
in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might
divide the pieces of gold.&#160; But, alas! no gold was in it, nor
silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child
who was asleep.</p>
<p>And one of them said to the other: ‘This is a bitter ending to
our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child
profit to a man?&#160; Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing
that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we
may not give to another.’</p>
<p>But his companion answered him: ‘Nay, but it were an evil thing
to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as
poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in
the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have
care of it.’</p>
<p>So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak
around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down
the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his
foolishness and softness of heart.</p>
<p>And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him,
‘Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet
that we should share.’</p>
<p>But he answered him: ‘Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor
thine, but the child’s only,’ and he bade him Godspeed, and went to
his own house and knocked.</p>
<p>And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had
returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed
him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the
snow off his boots, and bade him come in.</p>
<p>But he said to her, ‘I have found something in the forest, and I
have brought it to thee to have care of it,’ and he stirred not
from the threshold.</p>
<p>‘What is it?’ she cried.&#160; ‘Show it to me, for the house is
bare, and we have need of many things.’&#160; And he drew the cloak
back, and showed her the sleeping child.</p>
<p>‘Alack, goodman!’ she murmured, ‘have we not children of our
own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the
hearth?&#160; And who knows if it will not bring us bad
fortune?&#160; And how shall we tend it?’&#160; And she was wroth
against him.</p>
<p>‘Nay, but it is a Star-Child,’ he answered; and he told her the
strange manner of the finding of it.</p>
<p>But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke
angrily, and cried: ‘Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the
child of another?&#160; Who is there who careth for us?&#160; And
who giveth us food?’</p>
<p>‘Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,’
he answered.</p>
<p>‘Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?’ she
asked.&#160; ‘And is it not winter now?’</p>
<p>And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the
threshold.</p>
<p>And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door,
and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: ‘Wilt thou
not close the door?&#160; There cometh a bitter wind into the
house, and I am cold.’</p>
<p>‘Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a
bitter wind?’ he asked.&#160; And the woman answered him nothing,
but crept closer to the fire.</p>
<p>And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her
eyes were full of tears.&#160; And he came in swiftly, and placed
the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little
bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.&#160; And
on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and
placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the
child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.</p>
<p>So the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the
Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their
playmate.&#160; And every year he became more beautiful to look at,
so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder,
for, while they were swarthy and black-haired, he was white and
delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the
daffodil.&#160; His lips, also, were like the petals of a red
flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water,
and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes
not.</p>
<p>Yet did his beauty work him evil.&#160; For he grew proud, and
cruel, and selfish.&#160; The children of the Woodcutter, and the
other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were
of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star,
and he made himself master over them, and called them his
servants.&#160; No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were
blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at
them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their
bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that
village to ask for alms.&#160; Indeed, he was as one enamoured of
beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make
jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds
were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and
look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure
he had in his fairness.</p>
<p>Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: ‘We
did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left
desolate, and have none to succour them.&#160; Wherefore art thou
so cruel to all who need pity?’</p>
<p>Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the
love of living things, saying to him: ‘The fly is thy
brother.&#160; Do it no harm.&#160; The wild birds that roam
through the forest have their freedom.&#160; Snare them not for thy
pleasure.&#160; God made the blind-worm and the mole, and each has
its place.&#160; Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?&#160;
Even the cattle of the field praise Him.’</p>
<p>But the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and
flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.&#160; And his
companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and
could dance, and pipe, and make music.&#160; And wherever the
Star-Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star-Child bade
them do, that did they.&#160; And when he pierced with a sharp reed
the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at
the leper they laughed also.&#160; And in all things he ruled them,
and they became hard of heart even as he was.</p>
<p>Now there passed one day through the village a poor
beggar-woman.&#160; Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet
were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and
she was in very evil plight.&#160; And being weary she sat her down
under a chestnut-tree to rest.</p>
<p>But when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions,
‘See!&#160; There sitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and
green-leaved tree.&#160; Come, let us drive her hence, for she is
ugly and ill-favoured.’</p>
<p>So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she
looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze
from him.&#160; And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a
haggard hard by, saw what the Star-Child was doing, he ran up and
rebuked him, and said to him: ‘Surely thou art hard of heart and
knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee
that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot
upon the ground, and said, ‘Who art thou to question me what I
do?&#160; I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.’</p>
<p>‘Thou speakest truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘yet did I show
thee pity when I found thee in the forest.’</p>
<p>And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and
fell into a swoon.&#160; And the Woodcutter carried her to his own
house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the
swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before
her, and bade her have comfort.</p>
<p>But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter,
‘Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?&#160;
And was it not ten years from this day?’</p>
<p>And the Woodcutter answered, ‘Yea, it was in the forest that I
found him, and it is ten years from this day.’</p>
<p>‘And what signs didst thou find with him?’ she cried.&#160;
‘Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?&#160; Was not round
him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?’</p>
<p>‘Truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘it was even as thou
sayest.’&#160; And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the
chest where they lay, and showed them to her.</p>
<p>And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, ‘He is my
little son whom I lost in the forest.&#160; I pray thee send for
him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole
world.’</p>
<p>So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the
Star-Child, and said to him, ‘Go into the house, and there shalt
thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.’</p>
<p>So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.&#160; But
when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and
said, ‘Why, where is my mother?&#160; For I see none here but this
vile beggar-woman.’</p>
<p>And the woman answered him, ‘I am thy mother.’</p>
<p>‘Thou art mad to say so,’ cried the Star-Child angrily.&#160; ‘I
am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in
rags.&#160; Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face
no more.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the
forest,’ she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her
arms to him.&#160; ‘The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee
to die,’ she murmured, ‘but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and
the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and
the amber chain.&#160; Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over
the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.&#160; Come with
me, my son, for I have need of thy love.’</p>
<p>But the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the
doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save
the sound of the woman weeping for pain.</p>
<p>And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and
bitter.&#160; ‘If in very truth thou art my mother,’ he said, ‘it
had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring
me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star,
and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.&#160;
Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.’</p>
<p>‘Alas! my son,’ she cried, ‘wilt thou not kiss me before I
go?&#160; For I have suffered much to find thee.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ said the Star-Child, ‘but thou art too foul to look at,
and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.’</p>
<p>So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping
bitterly, and when the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was
glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with
them.</p>
<p>But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‘Why,
thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.&#160;
Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,’ and
they drave him out of the garden.</p>
<p>And the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, ‘What is this
that they say to me?&#160; I will go to the well of water and look
into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.’</p>
<p>So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his
face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an
adder.&#160; And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and
said to himself, ‘Surely this has come upon me by reason of my
sin.&#160; For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and
been proud, and cruel to her.&#160; Wherefore I will go and seek
her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found
her.’</p>
<p>And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and
she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, ‘What doth it matter
if thou hast lost thy comeliness?&#160; Stay with us, and I will
not mock at thee.’</p>
<p>And he said to her, ‘Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother,
and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.&#160; Wherefore
I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and
she give me her forgiveness.’</p>
<p>So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to
come to him, but there was no answer.&#160; All day long he called
to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of
leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they
remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that
watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.</p>
<p>And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries
from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great
wood, weeping sorely.&#160; And of everything that he met he made
inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother.</p>
<p>He said to the Mole, ‘Thou canst go beneath the earth.&#160;
Tell me, is my mother there?’</p>
<p>And the Mole answered, ‘Thou hast blinded mine eyes.&#160; How
should I know?’</p>
<p>He said to the Linnet, ‘Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall
trees, and canst see the whole world.&#160; Tell me, canst thou see
my mother?’</p>
<p>And the Linnet answered, ‘Thou hast clipt my wings for thy
pleasure.&#160; How should I fly?’</p>
<p>And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was
lonely, he said, ‘Where is my mother?’</p>
<p>And the Squirrel answered, ‘Thou hast slain mine.&#160; Dost
thou seek to slay thine also?’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed
forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest,
seeking for the beggar-woman.&#160; And on the third day he came to
the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.</p>
<p>And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him,
and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even
to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored
corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him
away, and there was none who had pity on him.&#160; Nor could he
hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was his mother, though for
the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often
seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to
her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to
bleed.&#160; But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by
the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her,
and they made sport of his sorrow.</p>
<p>For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in
the world there was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity
for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in
the days of his great pride.</p>
<p>And one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that
stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to
enter in.&#160; But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their
halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, ‘What is thy
business in the city?’</p>
<p>‘I am seeking for my mother,’ he answered, ‘and I pray ye to
suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.’</p>
<p>But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard,
and set down his shield and cried, ‘Of a truth, thy mother will not
be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than
the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.&#160;
Get thee gone.&#160; Get thee gone.&#160; Thy mother dwells not in
this city.’</p>
<p>And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him,
‘Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?’</p>
<p>And he answered, ‘My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have
treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may
give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this
city.’&#160; But they would not, and pricked him with their
spears.</p>
<p>And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with
gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings,
came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought
entrance.&#160; And they said to him, ‘It is a beggar and the child
of a beggar, and we have driven him away.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ he cried, laughing, ‘but we will sell the foul thing for
a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet
wine.’</p>
<p>And an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out,
and said, ‘I will buy him for that price,’ and, when he had paid
the price, he took the Star-Child by the hand and led him into the
city.</p>
<p>And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a
little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a
pomegranate tree.&#160; And the old man touched the door with a
ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps
of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of
burnt clay.&#160; And the old man took then from his turban a scarf
of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star-Child, and
drave him in front of him.&#160; And when the scarf was taken off
his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit
by a lantern of horn.</p>
<p>And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher
and said, ‘Eat,’ and some brackish water in a cup and said,
‘Drink,’ and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out,
locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron
chain.</p>
<p>And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of
the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt
in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and
said, ‘In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours
there are three pieces of gold.&#160; One is of white gold, and
another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is
red.&#160; To-day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and
if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred
stripes.&#160; Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be
waiting for thee at the door of the garden.&#160; See that thou
bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art
my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet
wine.’&#160; And he bound the eyes of the Star-Child with the scarf
of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the
garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.&#160; And having
opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.</p>
<p>And the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to
the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him.</p>
<p>Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed
full of singing birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the
Star-Child entered it gladly.&#160; Yet did its beauty profit him
little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from
the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the
thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore
distress.&#160; Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold
of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn
to noon, and from noon to sunset.&#160; And at sunset he set his
face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in
store for him.</p>
<p>But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from
a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.&#160; And forgetting his
own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare
caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.</p>
<p>And the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to
it, ‘I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.’</p>
<p>And the Hare answered him, and said: ‘Surely thou hast given me
freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child said to it, ‘I am seeking for a piece of
white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my
master he will beat me.’</p>
<p>‘Come thou with me,’ said the Hare, ‘and I will lead thee to it,
for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.’</p>
<p>So the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a
great oak-tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was
seeking.&#160; And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said
to the Hare, ‘The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered
back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee
thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.’</p>
<p>‘Nay,’ answered the Hare, ‘but as thou dealt with me, so I did
deal with thee,’ and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went
towards the city.</p>
<p>Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a
leper.&#160; Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through
the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.&#160; And when he saw
the Star-Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered
his bell, and called out to him, and said, ‘Give me a piece of
money, or I must die of hunger.&#160; For they have thrust me out
of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.’</p>
<p>‘Alas!’ cried the Star-Child, ‘I have but one piece of money in
my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for
I am his slave.’</p>
<p>But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the
Star-Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.</p>
<p>And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to
him, and brought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of
white gold?’&#160; And the Star-Child answered, ‘I have it
not.’&#160; So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set
before him an empty trencher, and said, ‘Eat,’ and an empty cup,
and said, ‘Drink,’ and flung him again into the dungeon.</p>
<p>And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day
thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep
thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.’</p>
<p>So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched
for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.&#160;
And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was
weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from
the trap,</p>
<p>And the Hare said to him, ‘Why art thou weeping?&#160; And what
dost thou seek in the wood?’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child answered, ‘I am seeking for a piece of yellow
gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat
me, and keep me as a slave.’</p>
<p>‘Follow me,’ cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it
came to a pool of water.&#160; And at the bottom of the pool the
piece of yellow gold was lying.</p>
<p>‘How shall I thank thee?’ said the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is
the second time that you have succoured me.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it
ran away swiftly.</p>
<p>And the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in
his wallet, and hurried to the city.&#160; But the leper saw him
coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, ‘Give me a
piece of money or I shall die of hunger.’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have in my wallet but one
piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will
beat me and keep me as his slave.’</p>
<p>But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had
pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.</p>
<p>And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to
him, and brought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of
yellow gold?’&#160; And the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have it
not.’&#160; So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded
him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.</p>
<p>And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day
thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if
thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.’</p>
<p>So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched
for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.&#160; And
at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there
came to him the little Hare.</p>
<p>And the Hare said to him, ‘The piece of red gold that thou
seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.&#160; Therefore weep
no more but be glad.’</p>
<p>‘How shall I reward thee?’ cried the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this
is the third time thou hast succoured me.’</p>
<p>‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it
ran away swiftly.</p>
<p>And the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest
corner he found the piece of red gold.&#160; So he put it in his
wallet, and hurried to the city.&#160; And the leper seeing him
coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to
him, ‘Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,’ and the
Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red
gold, saying, ‘Thy need is greater than mine.’&#160; Yet was his
heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.</p>
<p>But lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards
bowed down and made obeisance to him, saying, ‘How beautiful is our
lord!’ and a crowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, ‘Surely
there is none so beautiful in the whole world!’ so that the
Star-Child wept, and said to himself, ‘They are mocking me, and
making light of my misery.’&#160; And so large was the concourse of
the people, that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself
at last in a great square, in which there was a palace of a
King.</p>
<p>And the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high
officers of the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased
themselves before him, and said, ‘Thou art our lord for whom we
have been waiting, and the son of our King.’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child answered them and said, ‘I am no king’s son,
but the child of a poor beggar-woman.&#160; And how say ye that I
am beautiful, for I know that I am evil to look at?’</p>
<p>Then he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose
helmet crouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried,
‘How saith my lord that he is not beautiful?’</p>
<p>And the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had
been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in
his eyes which he had not seen there before.</p>
<p>And the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to
him, ‘It was prophesied of old that on this day should come he who
was to rule over us.&#160; Therefore, let our lord take this crown
and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy our King over
us.’</p>
<p>But he said to them, ‘I am not worthy, for I have denied the
mother who bare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known
her forgiveness.&#160; Therefore, let me go, for I must wander
again over the world, and may not tarry here, though ye bring me
the crown and the sceptre.’&#160; And as he spake he turned his
face from them towards the street that led to the gate of the city,
and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round the soldiers, he saw
the beggar-woman who was his mother, and at her side stood the
leper, who had sat by the road.</p>
<p>And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and
kneeling down he kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet
them with his tears.&#160; He bowed his head in the dust, and
sobbing, as one whose heart might break, he said to her: ‘Mother, I
denied thee in the hour of my pride.&#160; Accept me in the hour of
my humility.&#160; Mother, I gave thee hatred.&#160; Do thou give
me love.&#160; Mother, I rejected thee.&#160; Receive thy child
now.’&#160; But the beggar-woman answered him not a word.</p>
<p>And he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the
leper, and said to him: ‘Thrice did I give thee of my mercy.&#160;
Bid my mother speak to me once.’&#160; But the leper answered him
not a word.</p>
<p>And he sobbed again and said: ‘Mother, my suffering is greater
than I can bear.&#160; Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back
to the forest.’&#160; And the beggar-woman put her hand on his
head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ and the leper put his hand on his
head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ also.</p>
<p>And he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they
were a King and a Queen.</p>
<p>And the Queen said to him, ‘This is thy father whom thou hast
succoured.’</p>
<p>And the King said, ‘This is thy mother whose feet thou hast
washed with thy tears.’&#160; And they fell on his neck and kissed
him, and brought him into the palace and clothed him in fair
raiment, and set the crown upon his head, and the sceptre in his
hand, and over the city that stood by the river he ruled, and was
its lord.&#160; Much justice and mercy did he show to all, and the
evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his wife he
sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high
honour.&#160; Nor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast,
but taught love and loving-kindness and charity, and to the poor he
gave bread, and to the naked he gave raiment, and there was peace
and plenty in the land.</p>
<p>Yet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so
bitter the fire of his testing, for after the space of three years
he died.&#160; And he who came after him ruled evilly.</p>
