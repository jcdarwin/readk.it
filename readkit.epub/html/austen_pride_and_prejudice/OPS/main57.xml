<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>&#160;few days
after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend
had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten
days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with
many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged
elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more
lucky."</p>
<p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if
she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of
waiting on them.</p>
<p>"Can you come to-morrow?"</p>
<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her
invitation was accepted with alacrity.</p>
<p>He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of
them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her
dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:</p>
<p>"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley
is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come
to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never
mind Miss Lizzy's hair."</p>
<p>"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say
Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half
an hour ago."</p>
<p>"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be
quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"</p>
<p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to
go down without one of her sisters.</p>
<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in
the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was
his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two
obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking
and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,
without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe
her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is
the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to
do?"</p>
<p>"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat
still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious
occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my
love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane
instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
premeditation, and her entreaty that&#160;<em>she</em>&#160;would
not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the
door and called out:</p>
<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go.</p>
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her
mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going
upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."</p>
<p>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but
remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight,
then returned into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
daughter.</p>
<p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he
went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and
Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her
husband.</p>
<p>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a
word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth
went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be
concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must
have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.</p>
<p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet
spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was
much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing
of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule,
or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and
less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course
returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's
invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her
daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the
breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others
were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to
counteract her mother's schemes.</p>
<p>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was
finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to
fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the
door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over
the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led
to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round
and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their
situation was awkward enough; but&#160;<em>hers</em>&#160;she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who
as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a
few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</p>
<p>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence
would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,
with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in
the world.</p>
<p>"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve
it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a
warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every
sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But
she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half
that remained to be said for the present.</p>
<p>"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on
any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her
to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already.
Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such
pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much
happiness!"</p>
<p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken
up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity
and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given
them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.</p>
<p>"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference
with her father had been short and to the purpose.</p>
<p>"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the
door.</p>
<p>"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare
say."</p>
<p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good
wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily
expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They
shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came
down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness,
and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover,
Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be
rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent
understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a
general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.</p>
<p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the
satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet
animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty
simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs.
Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms
warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley
of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them
at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he
was.</p>
<p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till
their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was
gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:</p>
<p>"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."</p>
<p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.</p>
<p>"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You
are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved
on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous,
that you will always exceed your income."</p>
<p>"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters
would be unpardonable in me."</p>
<p>"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what
are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and
very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear
Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all
night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at
last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I
remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into
Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you
should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever
was seen!"</p>
<p>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition
her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her
younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of
happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.</p>
<p>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and
Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.</p>
<p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at
Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining
till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could
not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which
he thought himself obliged to accept.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her
sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow
on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both
of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In
the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for
the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane
constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>
<p>"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me
that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had
not believed it possible."</p>
<p>"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he
account for it?"</p>
<p>"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no
friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,
since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many
respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their
brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we
shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once
were to each other."</p>
<p>"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I
ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see
you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."</p>
<p>"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last
November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion
of&#160;<em>my</em>being indifferent would have prevented his
coming down again!"</p>
<p>"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of
his modesty."</p>
<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his
diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.
Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the
interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous
and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance
which must prejudice her against him.</p>
<p>"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"
cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and
blessed above them all! If I could but
see&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;as happy! If
there&#160;<em>were</em>&#160;but such another man for you!"</p>
<p>"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so
happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never
can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,
perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.
Collins in time."</p>
<p>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be
long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.
Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same
by all her neighbours in Meryton.</p>
<p>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family
in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first
run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for
misfortune.</p>
