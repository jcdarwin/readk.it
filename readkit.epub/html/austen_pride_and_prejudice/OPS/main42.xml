<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he first week of
their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of
the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the
neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat,
drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by
Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not
comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would
they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be
smiling so, Lizzy?"</p>
<p>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered
what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty
years ago.</p>
<p>"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when
Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken
my heart."</p>
<p>"I am sure I shall break&#160;<em>mine</em>," said Lydia.</p>
<p>"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable."</p>
<p>"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."</p>
<p>"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would
do&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;a great deal of good," added Kitty.</p>
<p>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually
through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them;
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the
justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much
disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.</p>
<p>But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for
she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the
colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This
invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her
and Lydia to each other, and out of
their&#160;<em>three</em>&#160;months' acquaintance they had been
intimate&#160;<em>two</em>.</p>
<p>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.
Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of
Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her
sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy,
calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking
with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued
in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her
accent was peevish.</p>
<p>"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not
ask&#160;<em>me</em>&#160;as well as Lydia," said she, "Though I
am&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;her particular friend. I have just as
much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years
older."</p>
<p>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane
to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was
so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and
Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all
possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such
a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly
advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all
the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little
advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as
Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent
with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be
greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:</p>
<p>"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some
public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."</p>
<p>"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great
disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of
Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already
arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the
affair."</p>
<p>"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened
away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast
down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a
little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list
of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."</p>
<p>"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It
is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now
complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must
be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of
all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must
speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of
checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her
present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will
soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed,
and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever
made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst
and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that
universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In
this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever
Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh!
my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be
censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their
sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:</p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are
known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to
less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very
silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does
not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible
man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily
too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will
be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been
here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let
us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own
insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse,
without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her
life."</p>
<p>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own
opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and
sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations
by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her
duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by
anxiety, was no part of her disposition.</p>
<p>Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference
with her father, their indignation would hardly have found
expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a
visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.
She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay
bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of
attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She
saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched forth in
beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay,
and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw
herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.</p>
<p>Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects
and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have
felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that
consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never
intending to go there himself.</p>
<p>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their
raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of
Lydia's leaving home.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having
been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was
pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so.
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had
first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and
weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a
fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified
of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of
their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed,
to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself
thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry;
and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof
contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be
gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their
renewal.</p>
<p>On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he
dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was
Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his
making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed
at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's
having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was
acquainted with the former.</p>
<p>He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly
seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very
gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was
warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon
afterwards added:</p>
<p>"How long did you say he was at Rosings?"</p>
<p>"Nearly three weeks."</p>
<p>"And you saw him frequently?"</p>
<p>"Yes, almost every day."</p>
<p>"His manners are very different from his cousin's."</p>
<p>"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon
acquaintance."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape
her. "And pray, may I ask?—" But checking himself, he added, in a
gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to
add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope,"
he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved
in essentials."</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very
much what he ever was."</p>
<p>While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether
to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was
a something in her countenance which made him listen with an
apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:</p>
<p>"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean
that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but
that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better
understood."</p>
<p>Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and
agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off
his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest
of accents:</p>
<p>"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will
readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise
enough to assume even the&#160;<em>appearance</em>&#160;of what is
right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to
himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul
misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of
cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely
adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh,
which I am certain he has very much at heart."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered
only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to
engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no
humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with
the<em>appearance</em>, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but
with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted
at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never
meeting again.</p>
<p>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to
Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than
pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep
from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes
for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions
that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as
much as possible—advice which there was every reason to believe
would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia
herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters
were uttered without being heard.</p>
