<h3 class="section_title">The Birthday of the Infanta</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>It was the birthday of the Infanta.&#160; She was just twelve
years of age, and the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of
the palace.</p>
<p>Although she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she
had only one birthday every year, just like the children of quite
poor people, so it was naturally a matter of great importance to
the whole country that she should have a really fine day for the
occasion.&#160; And a really fine day it certainly was.&#160; The
tall striped tulips stood straight up upon their stalks, like long
rows of soldiers, and looked defiantly across the grass at the
roses, and said: ‘We are quite as splendid as you are now.’&#160;
The purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their
wings, visiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out
of the crevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare;
and the pomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed
their bleeding red hearts.&#160; Even the pale yellow lemons, that
hung in such profusion from the mouldering trellis and along the
dim arcades, seemed to have caught a richer colour from the
wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia trees opened their great
globe-like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled the air with a
sweet heavy perfume.</p>
<p>The little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with
her companions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases
and the old moss-grown statues.&#160; On ordinary days she was only
allowed to play with children of her own rank, so she had always to
play alone, but her birthday was an exception, and the King had
given orders that she was to invite any of her young friends whom
she liked to come and amuse themselves with her.&#160; There was a
stately grace about these slim Spanish children as they glided
about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and short fluttering
cloaks, the girls holding up the trains of their long brocaded
gowns, and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of
black and silver.&#160; But the Infanta was the most graceful of
all, and the most tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous
fashion of the day.&#160; Her robe was of grey satin, the skirt and
the wide puffed sleeves heavily embroidered with silver, and the
stiff corset studded with rows of fine pearls.&#160; Two tiny
slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her dress as she
walked.&#160; Pink and pearl was her great gauze fan, and in her
hair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round
her pale little face, she had a beautiful white rose.</p>
<p>From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched
them.&#160; Behind him stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom
he hated, and his confessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat
by his side.&#160; Sadder even than usual was the King, for as he
looked at the Infanta bowing with childish gravity to the
assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan at the grim Duchess
of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought of the young
Queen, her mother, who but a short time before - so it seemed to
him - had come from the gay country of France, and had withered
away in the sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six
months after the birth of her child, and before she had seen the
almonds blossom twice in the orchard, or plucked the second year’s
fruit from the old gnarled fig-tree that stood in the centre of the
now grass-grown courtyard.&#160; So great had been his love for her
that he had not suffered even the grave to hide her from him.&#160;
She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who in return for
this service had been granted his life, which for heresy and
suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men
said, to the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its
tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as
the monks had borne her in on that windy March day nearly twelve
years before.&#160; Once every month the King, wrapped in a dark
cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand, went in and knelt by
her side calling out, ‘<em>Mi reina</em>!&#160;&#160;<em>Mi
reina</em>!’ and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette
that in Spain governs every separate action of life, and sets
limits even to the sorrow of a King, he would clutch at the pale
jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief, and try to wake by his mad
kisses the cold painted face.</p>
<p>To-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at
the Castle of Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age,
and she still younger.&#160; They had been formally betrothed on
that occasion by the Papal Nuncio in the presence of the French
King and all the Court, and he had returned to the Escurial bearing
with him a little ringlet of yellow hair, and the memory of two
childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his
carriage.&#160; Later on had followed the marriage, hastily
performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two
countries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the
customary celebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and
a more than usually solemn&#160;<em>auto-da-fé</em>, in which
nearly three hundred heretics, amongst whom were many Englishmen,
had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned.</p>
<p>Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought,
of his country, then at war with England for the possession of the
empire of the New World.&#160; He had hardly ever permitted her to
be out of his sight; for her, he had forgotten, or seemed to have
forgotten, all grave affairs of State; and, with that terrible
blindness that passion brings upon its servants, he had failed to
notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please
her did but aggravate the strange malady from which she
suffered.&#160; When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft
of reason.&#160; Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have
formally abdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at
Granada, of which he was already titular Prior, had he not been
afraid to leave the little Infanta at the mercy of his brother,
whose cruelty, even in Spain, was notorious, and who was suspected
by many of having caused the Queen’s death by means of a pair of
poisoned gloves that he had presented to her on the occasion of her
visiting his castle in Aragon.&#160; Even after the expiration of
the three years of public mourning that he had ordained throughout
his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his
ministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor
himself sent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely
Archduchess of Bohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the
ambassadors tell their master that the King of Spain was already
wedded to Sorrow, and that though she was but a barren bride he
loved her better than Beauty; an answer that cost his crown the
rich provinces of the Netherlands, which soon after, at the
Emperor’s instigation, revolted against him under the leadership of
some fanatics of the Reformed Church.</p>
<p>His whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured joys and
the terrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him
to-day as he watched the Infanta playing on the terrace.&#160; She
had all the Queen’s pretty petulance of manner, the same wilful way
of tossing her head, the same proud curved beautiful mouth, the
same wonderful smile -&#160;<em>vrai sourire de
France</em>&#160;indeed - as she glanced up now and then at the
window, or stretched out her little hand for the stately Spanish
gentlemen to kiss.&#160; But the shrill laughter of the children
grated on his ears, and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his
sorrow, and a dull odour of strange spices, spices such as
embalmers use, seemed to taint - or was it fancy? - the clear
morning air.&#160; He buried his face in his hands, and when the
Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King
had retired.</p>
<p>She made a little&#160;<em>moue</em>&#160;of disappointment, and
shrugged her shoulders.&#160; Surely he might have stayed with her
on her birthday.&#160; What did the stupid State-affairs
matter?&#160; Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where the
candles were always burning, and where she was never allowed to
enter?&#160; How silly of him, when the sun was shining so
brightly, and everybody was so happy!&#160; Besides, he would miss
the sham bull-fight for which the trumpet was already sounding, to
say nothing of the puppet-show and the other wonderful
things.&#160; Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were much more
sensible.&#160; They had come out on the terrace, and paid her nice
compliments.&#160; So she tossed her pretty head, and taking Don
Pedro by the hand, she walked slowly down the steps towards a long
pavilion of purple silk that had been erected at the end of the
garden, the other children following in strict order of precedence,
those who had the longest names going first.</p>
<p>A procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed
as&#160;<em>toreadors</em>, came out to meet her, and the young
Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully handsome lad of about fourteen
years of age, uncovering his head with all the grace of a born
hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to a little gilt
and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the
arena.&#160; The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering
their big fans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the
Grand Inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance.&#160; Even the
Duchess - the Camerera-Mayor as she was called - a thin,
hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not look quite so
bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile flitted
across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.</p>
<p>It certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the
Infanta thought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought
to see at Seville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of
Parma to her father.&#160; Some of the boys pranced about on
richly-caparisoned hobby-horses brandishing long javelins with gay
streamers of bright ribands attached to them; others went on foot
waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull, and vaulting lightly
over the barrier when he charged them; and as for the bull himself,
he was just like a live bull, though he was only made of
wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running
round the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of
doing.&#160; He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children
got so excited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their
lace handkerchiefs and cried out:&#160;<em>Bravo toro!&#160;
Bravo</em>&#160;<em>toro</em>! just as sensibly as if they had been
grown-up people.&#160; At last, however, after a prolonged combat,
during which several of the hobby-horses were gored through and
through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of
Tierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained
permission from the Infanta to give the&#160;<em>coup de
grâce</em>, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal
with such violence that the head came right off, and disclosed the
laughing face of little Monsieur de Lorraine, the son of the French
Ambassador at Madrid.</p>
<p>The arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead
hobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow
and black liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a
French posture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian
puppets appeared in the semi-classical tragedy
of&#160;<em>Sophonisba</em>&#160;on the stage of a small theatre
that had been built up for the purpose.&#160; They acted so well,
and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of
the play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.&#160;
Indeed some of the children really cried, and had to be comforted
with sweetmeats, and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected
that he could not help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him
intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax,
and worked mechanically by wires, should be so unhappy and meet
with such terrible misfortunes.</p>
<p>An African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket
covered with a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the
arena, he took from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew
through it.&#160; In a few moments the cloth began to move, and as
the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put
out their strange wedge-shaped heads and rose slowly up, swaying to
and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water.&#160; The
children, however, were rather frightened at their spotted hoods
and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased when the
juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear
pretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took
the fan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres, and
changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and
sang, their delight and amazement knew no bounds.&#160; The solemn
minuet, too, performed by the dancing boys from the church of
Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming.&#160; The Infanta had never
before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes place every year at
Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and in her
honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered
the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by
many to have been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to
administer a poisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.&#160; So
she had known only by hearsay of ‘Our Lady’s Dance,’ as it was
called, and it certainly was a beautiful sight.&#160; The boys wore
old-fashioned court dresses of white velvet, and their curious
three-cornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted with
huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling whiteness of their
costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being still more
accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair.&#160;
Everybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved
through the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate
grace of their slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had
finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to
the Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy,
and made a vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine
of Our Lady of Pilar in return for the pleasure that she had given
her.</p>
<p>A troop of handsome Egyptians - as the gipsies were termed in
those days - then advanced into the arena, and sitting down
cross-legs, in a circle, began to play softly upon their zithers,
moving their bodies to the tune, and humming, almost below their
breath, a low dreamy air.&#160; When they caught sight of Don Pedro
they scowled at him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a
few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery
in the market-place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them
as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes,
and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be
cruel to anybody.&#160; So they played on very gently and just
touching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails,
and their heads began to nod as though they were falling
asleep.&#160; Suddenly, with a cry so shrill that all the children
were startled and Don Pedro’s hand clutched at the agate pommel of
his dagger, they leapt to their feet and whirled madly round the
enclosure beating their tambourines, and chaunting some wild
love-song in their strange guttural language.&#160; Then at another
signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay there
quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound
that broke the silence.&#160; After that they had done this several
times, they disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown
shaggy bear by a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little
Barbary apes.&#160; The bear stood upon his head with the utmost
gravity, and the wizened apes played all kinds of amusing tricks
with two gipsy boys who seemed to be their masters, and fought with
tiny swords, and fired off guns, and went through a regular
soldier’s drill just like the King’s own bodyguard.&#160; In fact
the gipsies were a great success.</p>
<p>But the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was
undoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf.&#160; When he stumbled
into the arena, waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge
misshapen head from side to side, the children went off into a loud
shout of delight, and the Infanta herself laughed so much that the
Camerera was obliged to remind her that although there were many
precedents in Spain for a King’s daughter weeping before her
equals, there were none for a Princess of the blood royal making so
merry before those who were her inferiors in birth.&#160; The
Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the
Spanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the
horrible, so fantastic a little monster had never been seen.&#160;
It was his first appearance, too.&#160; He had been discovered only
the day before, running wild through the forest, by two of the
nobles who happened to have been hunting in a remote part of the
great cork-wood that surrounded the town, and had been carried off
by them to the Palace as a surprise for the Infanta; his father,
who was a poor charcoal-burner, being but too well pleased to get
rid of so ugly and useless a child.&#160; Perhaps the most amusing
thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own
grotesque appearance.&#160; Indeed he seemed quite happy and full
of the highest spirits.&#160; When the children laughed, he laughed
as freely and as joyously as any of them, and at the close of each
dance he made them each the funniest of bows, smiling and nodding
at them just as if he was really one of themselves, and not a
little misshapen thing that Nature, in some humourous mood, had
fashioned for others to mock at.&#160; As for the Infanta, she
absolutely fascinated him.&#160; He could not keep his eyes off
her, and seemed to dance for her alone, and when at the close of
the performance, remembering how she had seen the great ladies of
the Court throw bouquets to Caffarelli, the famous Italian treble,
whom the Pope had sent from his own chapel to Madrid that he might
cure the King’s melancholy by the sweetness of his voice, she took
out of her hair the beautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and
partly to tease the Camerera, threw it to him across the arena with
her sweetest smile, he took the whole matter quite seriously, and
pressing the flower to his rough coarse lips he put his hand upon
his heart, and sank on one knee before her, grinning from ear to
ear, and with his little bright eyes sparkling with pleasure.</p>
<p>This so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on
laughing long after the little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and
expressed a desire to her uncle that the dance should be
immediately repeated.&#160; The Camerera, however, on the plea that
the sun was too hot, decided that it would be better that her
Highness should return without delay to the Palace, where a
wonderful feast had been already prepared for her, including a real
birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it in painted
sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top.&#160; The
Infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given
orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the
hour of siesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of
Tierra-Nueva for his charming reception, she went back to her
apartments, the children following in the same order in which they
had entered.</p>
<p>Now when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second
time before the Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so
proud that he ran out into the garden, kissing the white rose in an
absurd ecstasy of pleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy
gestures of delight.</p>
<p>The Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into
their beautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down
the walks, and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous
manner, they could not restrain their feelings any longer.</p>
<p>‘He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place
where we are,’ cried the Tulips.</p>
<p>‘He should drink poppy-juice, and go to sleep for a thousand
years,’ said the great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and
angry.</p>
<p>‘He is a perfect horror!’ screamed the Cactus.&#160; ‘Why, he is
twisted and stumpy, and his head is completely out of proportion
with his legs.&#160; Really he makes me feel prickly all over, and
if he comes near me I will sting him with my thorns.’</p>
<p>‘And he has actually got one of my best blooms,’ exclaimed the
White Rose-Tree.&#160; ‘I gave it to the Infanta this morning
myself, as a birthday present, and he has stolen it from
her.’&#160; And she called out: ‘Thief, thief, thief!’ at the top
of her voice.</p>
<p>Even the red Geraniums, who did not usually give themselves
airs, and were known to have a great many poor relations
themselves, curled up in disgust when they saw him, and when the
Violets meekly remarked that though he was certainly extremely
plain, still he could not help it, they retorted with a good deal
of justice that that was his chief defect, and that there was no
reason why one should admire a person because he was incurable;
and, indeed, some of the Violets themselves felt that the ugliness
of the little Dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that he would have
shown much better taste if he had looked sad, or at least pensive,
instead of jumping about merrily, and throwing himself into such
grotesque and silly attitudes.</p>
<p>As for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable
individual, and had once told the time of day to no less a person
than the Emperor Charles V. himself, he was so taken aback by the
little Dwarf’s appearance, that he almost forgot to mark two whole
minutes with his long shadowy finger, and could not help saying to
the great milk-white Peacock, who was sunning herself on the
balustrade, that every one knew that the children of Kings were
Kings, and that the children of charcoal-burners were
charcoal-burners, and that it was absurd to pretend that it wasn’t
so; a statement with which the Peacock entirely agreed, and indeed
screamed out, ‘Certainly, certainly,’ in such a loud, harsh voice,
that the gold-fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing
fountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone
Tritons what on earth was the matter.</p>
<p>But somehow the Birds liked him.&#160; They had seen him often
in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves,
or crouched up in the hollow of some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts
with the squirrels.&#160; They did not mind his being ugly, a
bit.&#160; Why, even the nightingale herself, who sang so sweetly
in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon leaned down
to listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides, he had
been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when
there were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as
iron, and the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to
look for food, he had never once forgotten them, but had always
given them crumbs out of his little hunch of black bread, and
divided with them whatever poor breakfast he had.</p>
<p>So they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with
their wings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the
little Dwarf was so pleased that he could not help showing them the
beautiful white rose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had
given it to him because she loved him.</p>
<p>They did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but
that made no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and
looked wise, which is quite as good as understanding a thing, and
very much easier.</p>
<p>The Lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and when he grew
tired of running about and flung himself down on the grass to rest,
they played and romped all over him, and tried to amuse him in the
best way they could.&#160; ‘Every one cannot be as beautiful as a
lizard,’ they cried; ‘that would be too much to expect.&#160; And,
though it sounds absurd to say so, he is really not so ugly after
all, provided, of course, that one shuts one’s eyes, and does not
look at him.’&#160; The Lizards were extremely philosophical by
nature, and often sat thinking for hours and hours together, when
there was nothing else to do, or when the weather was too rainy for
them to go out.</p>
<p>The Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their
behaviour, and at the behaviour of the birds.&#160; ‘It only
shows,’ they said, ‘what a vulgarising effect this incessant
rushing and flying about has.&#160; Well-bred people always stay
exactly in the same place, as we do.&#160; No one ever saw us
hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the grass
after dragon-flies.&#160; When we do want change of air, we send
for the gardener, and he carries us to another bed.&#160; This is
dignified, and as it should be.&#160; But birds and lizards have no
sense of repose, and indeed birds have not even a permanent
address.&#160; They are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should
be treated in exactly the same manner.’&#160; So they put their
noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted
when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the
grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.</p>
<p>‘He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural
life,’ they said.&#160; ‘Look at his hunched back, and his crooked
legs,’ and they began to titter.</p>
<p>But the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.&#160; He liked
the birds and the lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers
were the most marvellous things in the whole world, except of
course the Infanta, but then she had given him the beautiful white
rose, and she loved him, and that made a great difference.&#160;
How he wished that he had gone back with her!&#160; She would have
put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he would have
never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and
taught her all kinds of delightful tricks.&#160; For though he had
never been in a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful
things.&#160; He could make little cages out of rushes for the
grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into
the pipe that Pan loves to hear.&#160; He knew the cry of every
bird, and could call the starlings from the tree-top, or the heron
from the mere.&#160; He knew the trail of every animal, and could
track the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the
trampled leaves.&#160; All the wild-dances he knew, the mad dance
in red raiment with the autumn, the light dance in blue sandals
over the corn, the dance with white snow-wreaths in winter, and the
blossom-dance through the orchards in spring.&#160; He knew where
the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once when a fowler had
snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young ones himself,
and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a pollard
elm.&#160; They were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands
every morning.&#160; She would like them, and the rabbits that
scurried about in the long fern, and the jays with their steely
feathers and black bills, and the hedgehogs that could curl
themselves up into prickly balls, and the great wise tortoises that
crawled slowly about, shaking their heads and nibbling at the young
leaves.&#160; Yes, she must certainly come to the forest and play
with him.&#160; He would give her his own little bed, and would
watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild horned
cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the
hut.&#160; And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her,
and they would go out and dance together all the day long.&#160; It
was really not a bit lonely in the forest.&#160; Sometimes a Bishop
rode through on his white mule, reading out of a painted
book.&#160; Sometimes in their green velvet caps, and their jerkins
of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with hooded hawks on
their wrists.&#160; At vintage-time came the grape-treaders, with
purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying
dripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners sat round their
huge braziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in
the fire, and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came
out of their caves and made merry with them.&#160; Once, too, he
had seen a beautiful procession winding up the long dusty road to
Toledo.&#160; The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying
bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour,
with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst
walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all
over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their
hands.&#160; Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the
forest, and when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss
for her, or carry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though
he knew that he was not tall.&#160; He would make her a necklace of
red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white
berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them,
she could throw them away, and he would find her others.&#160; He
would bring her acorn-cups and dew-drenched anemones, and tiny
glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair.</p>
<p>But where was she?&#160; He asked the white rose, and it made
him no answer.&#160; The whole palace seemed asleep, and even where
the shutters had not been closed, heavy curtains had been drawn
across the windows to keep out the glare.&#160; He wandered all
round looking for some place through which he might gain an
entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private door that
was lying open.&#160; He slipped through, and found himself in a
splendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there
was so much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of
great coloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical
pattern.&#160; But the little Infanta was not there, only some
wonderful white statues that looked down on him from their jasper
pedestals, with sad blank eyes and strangely smiling lips.</p>
<p>At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of
black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite
devices, and broidered on the colour he loved best.&#160; Perhaps
she was hiding behind that?&#160; He would try at any rate.</p>
<p>So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.&#160; No; there
was only another room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the
one he had just left.&#160; The walls were hung with a many-figured
green arras of needle-wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the
work of some Flemish artists who had spent more than seven years in
its composition.&#160; It had once been the chamber
of&#160;<em>Jean le Fou</em>, as he was called, that mad King who
was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his
delirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the
stag on which the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting
horn, and stabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.&#160;
It was now used as the council-room, and on the centre table were
lying the red portfolios of the ministers, stamped with the gold
tulips of Spain, and with the arms and emblems of the house of
Hapsburg.</p>
<p>The little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was
half-afraid to go on.&#160; The strange silent horsemen that
galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any
noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had
heard the charcoal-burners speaking - the Comprachos, who hunt only
at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase
him.&#160; But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took
courage.&#160; He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he
too loved her.&#160; Perhaps she was in the room beyond.</p>
<p>He ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the
door.&#160; No!&#160; She was not here either.&#160; The room was
quite empty.</p>
<p>It was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign
ambassadors, when the King, which of late had not been often,
consented to give them a personal audience; the same room in which,
many years before, envoys had appeared from England to make
arrangements for the marriage of their Queen, then one of the
Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor’s eldest son.&#160;
The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt
chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down
from the black and white ceiling.&#160; Underneath a great canopy
of gold cloth, on which the lions and towers of Castile were
broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered with a
rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and
elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.&#160; On the second
step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the Infanta,
with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that again,
and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal
Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King’s presence
on the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal’s hat,
with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a
purple&#160;<em>tabouret</em>&#160;in front.&#160; On the wall,
facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in
hunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of
Philip II. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the
centre of the other wall.&#160; Between the windows stood a black
ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures
from Holbein’s Dance of Death had been graved - by the hand, some
said, of that famous master himself.</p>
<p>But the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this
magnificence.&#160; He would not have given his rose for all the
pearls on the canopy, nor one white petal of his rose for the
throne itself.&#160; What he wanted was to see the Infanta before
she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away with him
when he had finished his dance.&#160; Here, in the Palace, the air
was close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the
sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves
aside.&#160; There were flowers, too, in the forest, not so
splendid, perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly
scented for all that; hyacinths in early spring that flooded with
waving purple the cool glens, and grassy knolls; yellow primroses
that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the
oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and irises lilac
and gold.&#160; There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the
foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted
cells.&#160; The chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the
hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty.&#160; Yes: surely she would
come if he could only find her!&#160; She would come with him to
the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her
delight.&#160; A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he
passed into the next room.</p>
<p>Of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most
beautiful.&#160; The walls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca
damask, patterned with birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of
silver; the furniture was of massive silver, festooned with florid
wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in front of the two large fire-places
stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks, and the
floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed to stretch far away into
the distance.&#160; Nor was he alone.&#160; Standing under the
shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a
little figure watching him.&#160; His heart trembled, a cry of joy
broke from his lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.&#160; As
he did so, the figure moved out also, and he saw it plainly.</p>
<p>The Infanta!&#160; It was a monster, the most grotesque monster
he had ever beheld.&#160; Not properly shaped, as all other people
were, but hunchbacked, and crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head
and mane of black hair.&#160; The little Dwarf frowned, and the
monster frowned also.&#160; He laughed, and it laughed with him,
and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was
doing.&#160; He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low
reverence.&#160; He went towards it, and it came to meet him,
copying each step that he made, and stopping when he stopped
himself.&#160; He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and
reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and
it was as cold as ice.&#160; He grew afraid, and moved his hand
across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.&#160; He tried
to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.&#160; The
face of the monster was now close to his own, and seemed full of
terror.&#160; He brushed his hair off his eyes.&#160; It imitated
him.&#160; He struck at it, and it returned blow for blow.&#160; He
loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him.&#160; He drew back,
and it retreated.</p>
<p>What is it?&#160; He thought for a moment, and looked round at
the rest of the room.&#160; It was strange, but everything seemed
to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water.&#160;
Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch for couch.&#160;
The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the doorway had its
twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that stood in the
sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.</p>
<p>Was it Echo?&#160; He had called to her once in the valley, and
she had answered him word for word.&#160; Could she mock the eye,
as she mocked the voice?&#160; Could she make a mimic world just
like the real world?&#160; Could the shadows of things have colour
and life and movement?&#160; Could it be that -&#160;?</p>
<p>He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose,
he turned round, and kissed it.&#160; The monster had a rose of its
own, petal for petal the same!&#160; It kissed it with like kisses,
and pressed it to its heart with horrible gestures.</p>
<p>When the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair,
and fell sobbing to the ground.&#160; So it was he who was
misshapen and hunchbacked, foul to look at and grotesque.&#160; He
himself was the monster, and it was at him that all the children
had been laughing, and the little Princess who he had thought loved
him - she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness, and making
merry over his twisted limbs.&#160; Why had they not left him in
the forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he
was?&#160; Why had his father not killed him, rather than sell him
to his shame?&#160; The hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he
tore the white rose to pieces.&#160; The sprawling monster did the
same, and scattered the faint petals in the air.&#160; It grovelled
on the ground, and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a
face drawn with pain.&#160; He crept away, lest he should see it,
and covered his eyes with his hands.&#160; He crawled, like some
wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.</p>
<p>And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her
companions through the open window, and when they saw the ugly
little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the floor with his
clenched hands, in the most fantastic and exaggerated manner, they
went off into shouts of happy laughter, and stood all round him and
watched him.</p>
<p>‘His dancing was funny,’ said the Infanta; ‘but his acting is
funnier still.&#160; Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets,
only of course not quite so natural.’&#160; And she fluttered her
big fan, and applauded.</p>
<p>But the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter
and fainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his
side.&#160; And then he fell back again, and lay quite still.</p>
<p>‘That is capital,’ said the Infanta, after a pause; ‘but now you
must dance for me.’</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ cried all the children, ‘you must get up and dance, for
you are as clever as the Barbary apes, and much more
ridiculous.’&#160; But the little Dwarf made no answer.</p>
<p>And the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle,
who was walking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some
despatches that had just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office
had recently been established.&#160; ‘My funny little dwarf is
sulking,’ she cried, ‘you must wake him up, and tell him to dance
for me.’</p>
<p>They smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro
stooped down, and slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his
embroidered glove.&#160; ‘You must dance,’ he said,&#160;<em>‘petit
monsire</em>.&#160; You must dance.&#160; The Infanta of Spain and
the Indies wishes to be amused.’</p>
<p>But the little Dwarf never moved.</p>
<p>‘A whipping master should be sent for,’ said Don Pedro wearily,
and he went back to the terrace.&#160; But the Chamberlain looked
grave, and he knelt beside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon
his heart.&#160; And after a few moments he shrugged his shoulders,
and rose up, and having made a low bow to the Infanta, he said
-</p>
<p><em>‘Mi bella Princesa</em>, your funny little dwarf will never
dance again.&#160; It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might
have made the King smile.’</p>
<p>‘But why will he not dance again?’ asked the Infanta,
laughing.</p>
<p>‘Because his heart is broken,’ answered the Chamberlain.</p>
<p>And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in
pretty disdain.&#160; ‘For the future let those who come to play
with me have no hearts,’ she cried, and she ran out into the
garden.</p>
