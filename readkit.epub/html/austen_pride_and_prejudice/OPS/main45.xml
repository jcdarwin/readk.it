<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">E</span>lizabeth, as they
drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods
with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the
lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.</p>
<p>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some
time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and
admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually
ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a
considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was
instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side
of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was
a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground,
and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream
of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without
any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor
falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a
place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had
been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of
them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to
be mistress of Pemberley might be something!</p>
<p>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the
door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her
apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the
chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they
were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the
housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.</p>
<p>The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much
less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.
They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well
proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly
surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill,
crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased
abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every
disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole
scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding
of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they
passed into other rooms these objects were taking different
positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with
less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of
Rosings.</p>
<p>"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress!
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in
them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.
But no,"—recollecting herself—"that could never be; my uncle and
aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to
invite them."</p>
<p>This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very
like regret.</p>
<p>She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was
really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,
the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with
alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we
expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced
was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance
been delayed a day!</p>
<p>Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and
saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,
how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it
was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's
steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. "He is
now gone into the army," she added; "but I am afraid he has turned
out very wild."</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth
could not return it.</p>
<p>"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the
miniatures, "is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the
same time as the other—about eight years ago."</p>
<p>"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But,
Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.</p>
<p>"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little."</p>
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"</p>
<p>"Yes, very handsome."</p>
<p>"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs
you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room
was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just
as they used to be then. He was very fond of them."</p>
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among
them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss
Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.</p>
<p>"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs.
Gardiner.</p>
<p>"Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master;
she comes here to-morrow with him."</p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,
encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.
Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great
pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.</p>
<p>"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the
year?"</p>
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend
half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer
months."</p>
<p>"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."</p>
<p>"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; but I do not know when&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;will
be. I do not know who is good enough for him."</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,
"It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think
so."</p>
<p>"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows
him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty
far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the
housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from him in my
life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."</p>
<p>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite
to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her
firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to
hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:</p>
<p>"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are
lucky in having such a master."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I
could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they
who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow
up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted
boy in the world."</p>
<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought
she.</p>
<p>"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like
him—just as affable to the poor."</p>
<p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for
more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She
related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,
and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly
amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her
excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the
subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they
proceeded together up the great staircase.</p>
<p>"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that
ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of
nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants
but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am
sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he
does not rattle away like other young men."</p>
<p>"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked,
"is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor
friend."</p>
<p>"Perhaps we might be deceived."</p>
<p>"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."</p>
<p>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was
but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a
liking to the room when last at Pemberley.</p>
<p>"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked
towards one of the windows.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should
enter the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added.
"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a
moment. There is nothing he would not do for her."</p>
<p>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,
were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good
paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as
had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at
some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were
usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.</p>
<p>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could
have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in
quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At
last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr.
Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have
sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes
before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it
again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them
that it had been taken in his father's lifetime.</p>
<p>There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more
gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the
height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by
Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more
valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a
landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were
in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in his
power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him!
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was
favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on
which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she
thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it
had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its
impropriety of expression.</p>
<p>When all of the house that was open to general inspection had
been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the
housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at
the hall-door.</p>
<p>As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth
turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and
while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,
the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which
led behind it to the stables.</p>
<p>They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was
his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their
eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the
deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed
immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced
towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of
perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.</p>
<p>She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the
picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure
the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's
expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately
have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to
their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her
eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his
civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his
manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was
increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of
her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in
which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her
life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke
the distraction of his thoughts.</p>
<p>At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a
few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself,
and took leave.</p>
<p>The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her
own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by
shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the
most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to
him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way
again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before
he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should
have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain
that he was that moment arrived—that moment alighted from his horse
or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness
of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could
it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak
with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life
had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken
with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast
did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his
letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.</p>
<p>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,
and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a
finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was
some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though
she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and
aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed
out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all
fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be,
where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was
passing in his mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether,
in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he
had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had
been&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;in his voice which was not like ease.
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she
could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.</p>
<p>At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence
of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more
like herself.</p>
<p>They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a
while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where
the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many
charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long
range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the
stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole
park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile
they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter;
and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again,
after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of
the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a
simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it
was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which
bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when
they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the
house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no
farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly
as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they
took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river,
in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr.
Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of
fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional
appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about
them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow
manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being
here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him
before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more
prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and
to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a
few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into
some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk
concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately
before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his
recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they
met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond
the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky
recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley
from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and
she said no more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,
he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to
her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite
unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now
seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom
his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his
surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them
now for people of fashion."</p>
<p>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she
named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him,
to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his
decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.
That he was&#160;<em>surprised</em>&#160;by the connection was
evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from
going away, turned his back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened
most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in
every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his
intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.
Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as
often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering
at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing
out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.
Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her
a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it
gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.
Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she
repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It
cannot be for&#160;<em>me</em>—it cannot be
for&#160;<em>my</em>&#160;sake that his manners are thus softened.
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is
impossible that he should still love me."</p>
<p>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front,
the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after
descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of
some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.
It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of
the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and
consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by
her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the
lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured
of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began
by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—"for your
housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not
be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we
understood that you were not immediately expected in the country."
He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with
his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before
the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They will
join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his
sisters."</p>
<p>Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were
instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been
the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his
complexion,&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;mind was not very differently
engaged.</p>
<p>"There is also one other person in the party," he continued
after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you.
Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to
your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"</p>
<p>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too
great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She
immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of
being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,
without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to
know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of
her.</p>
<p>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was
flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her
was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the
others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.</p>
<p>He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared
herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a
time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She
wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they
talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time
and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were
nearly worn our before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and
take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on
each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into
the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.</p>
<p>The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of
them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had
expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"
said her uncle.</p>
<p>"There&#160;<em>is</em>&#160;something a little stately in him,
to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and
is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though
some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it."</p>
<p>"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was
more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no
necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was
very trifling."</p>
<p>"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as
Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his
features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he
was so disagreeable?"</p>
<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she
had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and
that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.</p>
<p>"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,"
replied her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall
not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day,
and warn me off his grounds."</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his
character, but said nothing.</p>
<p>"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I
really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so
cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not
an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing
about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity
in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of
his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house
did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing
aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,
and&#160;<em>that</em>&#160;in the eye of a servant comprehends
every virtue."</p>
<p>Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in
vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to
understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she
had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a
very different construction; and that his character was by no means
so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in
Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars
of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected,
without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as
might be relied on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way
to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in
pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its
environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the
morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in
quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the
satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years'
discontinuance.</p>
<p>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave
Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she
could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's
civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with
his sister.</p>
