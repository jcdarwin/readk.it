<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span>iss Bingley's
letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence
conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the
winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he
left the country.</p>
<p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the
rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed
affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss
Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were
again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing
intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes
which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with
great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's
house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with
regard to new furniture.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all
this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between
concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To
Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy
she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no
more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been
disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly
without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper
resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends,
and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of
their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only
sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever
manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.
She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard
had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends'
interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or
whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case,
though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the
difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace
equally wounded.</p>
<p>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her
feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them
together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield
and its master, she could not help saying:</p>
<p>"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can
have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections
on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be
forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but
said nothing.</p>
<p>"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you
have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of
my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or
fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have
not<em>that</em>&#160;pain. A little time, therefore—I shall
certainly try to get the better."</p>
<p>With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort
immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my
side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."</p>
<p>"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your
sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know
what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or
loved you as you deserve."</p>
<p>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and
threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.</p>
<p>"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not
fair.&#160;<em>You</em>&#160;wish to think all the world
respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to
think&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;perfect, and you set yourself against
it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my
encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not.
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I
think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied
with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of
all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be
placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two
instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's
marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!"</p>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They
will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for
difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's
respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember
that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most
eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that
she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."</p>
<p>"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no
one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I
persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only
think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My
dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,
silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as
well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper
way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte
Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the
meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness."</p>
<p>"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"
replied Jane; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing
them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something
else. You mentioned&#160;<em>two</em>&#160;instances. I cannot
misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by
thinking&#160;<em>that person</em>&#160;to blame, and saying your
opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves
intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be
always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our
own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."</p>
<p>"And men take care that they should."</p>
<p>"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have
no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons
imagine."</p>
<p>"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to
design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to
make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and
want of resolution, will do the business."</p>
<p>"And do you impute it to either of those?"</p>
<p>"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by
saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you
can."</p>
<p>"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."</p>
<p>"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They
can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other
woman can secure it."</p>
<p>"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides
his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and
consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the
importance of money, great connections, and pride."</p>
<p>"Beyond a doubt, they&#160;<em>do</em>&#160;wish him to choose
Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings
than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they
have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may
be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed
their brother's. What sister would think herself at liberty to do
it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they
believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he
were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection,
you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having
been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in
comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his
sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it
may be understood."</p>
<p>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.
Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his
returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which
Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance
of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter
endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself,
that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common
and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but
though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,
she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he
one day, "your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate
her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in
love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a
sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to
come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your
time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the
young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would
jilt you creditably."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We
must not all expect Jane's good fortune."</p>
<p>"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that
whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate
mother who will make the most of it."</p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the
gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the
Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other
recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole
of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and
all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and
publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they
had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the
matter.</p>
<p>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might
be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the
society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always
pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but
by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.</p>
