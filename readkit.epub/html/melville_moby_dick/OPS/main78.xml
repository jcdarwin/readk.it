The Great Heidelburgh Tun</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright,
you must know something of the curious internal structure of the
thing operated upon.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on
an inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_16" id=
"footnote_16_call">[16]</a>&#160;whereof the lower is the bony
structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an unctuous
mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of
the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you
have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by
an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.</p>
<p>The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense
honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten
thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres
throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may
be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as
that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the
whale’s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for
the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that
of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of
the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains
by far the most precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the
highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and
odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed
in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains
perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it
soon begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline
shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in
water. A large whale’s case generally yields about five hundred
gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances,
considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is
otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing
what you can.</p>
<p>I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh
Tun was coated within, but in superlative richness that coating
could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-colored
membrane, like the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner
surface of the Sperm Whale’s case.</p>
<p>It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm
Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and
since—as has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third
of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down
at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than
twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise
hoisted up and down against a ship’s side.</p>
<p>As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is
brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced
into the spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly
heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the
sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents. It is this
decapitated end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of
the water, and retained in that position by the enormous cutting
tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a
wilderness of ropes in that quarter.</p>
<p>Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous
and— in this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the
Sperm Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.</p>
