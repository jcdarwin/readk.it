satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she
possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than,
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.</p>
<p>"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.</p>
<p>"MY DEAR NIECE,</p>
<p>"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
morning to answering it, as I foresee that
a&#160;<em>little</em>&#160;writing will not comprise what I have
to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I
did not expect it from&#160;<em>you</em>. Don't think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined
such inquiries to be necessary on&#160;<em>your</em>&#160;side. If
you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your
uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of
your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he
has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be
more explicit.</p>
<p>"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle
had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up
with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my
curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
as&#160;<em>yours</em>&#160;seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham
were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham
repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire
only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution
of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its
being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so
well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of
character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the
whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before
thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the
world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it,
therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an
evil which had been brought on by himself. If he&#160;<em>had
another</em>&#160;motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He
had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them;
but he had something to direct his search, which was more
than&#160;<em>we</em>&#160;had; and the consciousness of this was
another reason for his resolving to follow us.</p>
<p>"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some
cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took
a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by
letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately
acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him
as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he
could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust,
I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know
where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on
their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive
them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.
At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for
direction. They were in —— street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards
insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present
disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they
could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as
far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on
remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she
wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She
was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not
much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained,
he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very
first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;design. He confessed himself obliged to
leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were
very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of
Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his
commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could
conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did
not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have
been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,
that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such
circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
temptation of immediate relief.</p>
<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was
reduced to be reasonable.</p>
<p>"Every thing being settled between&#160;<em>them</em>, Mr.
Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he
first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.
But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further
inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town
the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom
he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily
postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did
not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a
gentleman had called on business.</p>
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at
home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk
together.</p>
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then&#160;<em>I</em>&#160;saw him
too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the
express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very
obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his
character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at
different times, but&#160;<em>this</em>&#160;is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure
(and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about
it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</p>
<p>"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than
either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last
your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be
of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the
probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I
really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure,
because it required an explanation that would rob him of his
borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But,
Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.</p>
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the
young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to
considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in
addition to her own settled upon&#160;<em>her</em>, and his
commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him
alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his
reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character
had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in&#160;<em>this</em>; though I doubt
whether&#160;<em>his</em>&#160;reserve,
or&#160;<em>anybody's</em>&#160;reserve, can be answerable for the
event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you
may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have
yielded, if we had not given him credit for&#160;<em>another
interest</em>&#160;in the affair.</p>
<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his
friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed
that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place,
and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.</p>
<p>"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation
which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it
will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham
had constant admission to the house.&#160;<em>He</em>&#160;was
exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I
would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour
while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter
last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,
it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth
and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.</p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed
you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was
to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very
angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying
(what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.
His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when
we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please
me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness,
and&#160;<em>that</em>, if he marry&#160;<em>prudently</em>, his
wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever
mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.</p>
<p>"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do
not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be
quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,
with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.</p>
<p>"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me
this half hour.</p>
<p>"Yours, very sincerely,</p>
<p>"M. GARDINER."</p>
<p>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of
spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or
pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions
which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been
doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to
encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and
at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation,
were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had
followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate
and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet,
reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always
most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him
to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither
regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for
her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and
she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required
to depend on his affection for her—for a woman who had already
refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as
abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of
Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He
had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But
he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should
feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of
exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his
principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining
partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her
peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful,
exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a
person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration
of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did
she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,
every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself
she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of
compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of
himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and
again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that
affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and
herself.</p>
<p>She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"
said he, as he joined her.</p>
<p>"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not
follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."</p>
<p>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good
friends; and now we are better."</p>
<p>"True. Are the others coming out?"</p>
<p>"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage
to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and
aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."</p>
<p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be
too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was
always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name
to you."</p>
<p>"Yes, she did."</p>
<p>"And what did she say?"</p>
<p>"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not
turned out well. At such a distance as&#160;<em>that</em>, you
know, things are strangely misrepresented."</p>
<p>"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she
had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:</p>
<p>"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each
other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."</p>
<p>"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at
this time of year."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I
thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."</p>
<p>"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."</p>
<p>"And do you like her?"</p>
<p>"Very much."</p>
<p>"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within
this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising.
I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."</p>
<p>"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."</p>
<p>"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"</p>
<p>"I do not recollect that we did."</p>
<p>"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have
had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would
have suited me in every respect."</p>
<p>"How should you have liked making sermons?"</p>
<p>"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my
duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not
to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!
The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my
ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy
mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"</p>
<p>"I have heard from authority, which I thought&#160;<em>as
good</em>, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will
of the present patron."</p>
<p>"You have. Yes, there was something in&#160;<em>that</em>; I
told you so from the first, you may remember."</p>
<p>"I&#160;<em>did</em>&#160;hear, too, that there was a time, when
sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at
present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking
orders, and that the business had been compromised
accordingly."</p>
<p>"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may
remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of
it."</p>
<p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had
walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's
sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured
smile:</p>
<p>"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not
let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always
of one mind."</p>
<p>She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,
though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.</p>
