<p>In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught
but substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an
advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise,
which might tell eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would
he not be blame-worthy?</p>
<p>It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens,
even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for
their functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so
called, and there may be a caster of state. How they use the salt,
precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is
solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it
be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior
run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,
concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who
anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth,
a mature man who uses hairoil, unless medicinally, that man has
probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he
can’t amount to much in his totality.</p>
<p>But the only thing to be considered here is this—what kind of
oil is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor
macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor
cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but the sperm oil in
its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?</p>
<p>Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings
and queens with coronation stuff!</p>
